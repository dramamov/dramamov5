WEBVTT

00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:02.500
I want to play the game again.

00:00:03.071 --> 00:00:05.416
Why did you suddenly want to play

00:00:05.607 --> 00:00:08.422
when you were stopping us from
rolling the dice before?

00:00:08.742 --> 00:00:11.099
What I do is none of your business.

00:00:11.989 --> 00:00:13.502
What do you think Benz means?

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.651
What is in this room?

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.896
How is that possible?

00:00:20.303 --> 00:00:21.303
The snake card.

00:00:22.025 --> 00:00:23.096
But outside…

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.352
We can’t leave.

00:00:45.604 --> 00:00:48.020
If a ladder card can bring
Benz to the upper floor,

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.774
a snake card can likely place someone
on the lower floor.

00:00:50.798 --> 00:00:52.900
So snakes cards are for
slowing others down?

00:01:53.666 --> 00:01:54.666
Aom.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:58.370
Aom.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:02.430
Aom.

00:02:03.305 --> 00:02:04.305
Aom.

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:05.902
Aom, we need to play the game.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.682
Aom, focus on the game at hand.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.200
Look at me.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.149
The prizes from this game
might get us out of here.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.280
Let’s play.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.100
Players, take turns removing
a chair from the pile.

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.851
The player that makes the pile
fall over loses.

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:33.570
Game over.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.965
Claim your prize in the hall.

00:03:55.382 --> 00:03:56.382
A dice?

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:59.330
Let me try.

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:16.170
Why did you do that?

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.390
You need that dice for the next turn.

00:04:25.632 --> 00:04:27.352
You’re hiding something from me,
aren’t you?

00:04:29.506 --> 00:04:30.506
Answer me!

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.197
What was that we saw outside?

00:04:33.678 --> 00:04:35.207
What happens if we can’t leave?

00:04:35.222 --> 00:04:36.222
I don’t know!

00:04:39.205 --> 00:04:40.205
You don’t know?

00:04:42.205 --> 00:04:43.788
You played this game before.

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.251
What we saw out there was more than
what a simple game can do.

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:53.136
You knew how dangerous this is,
but you still chose to play.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.900
Whatever your desire is,
is it that important to you?

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.099
If it wasn’t important, I wouldn’t play
this game now, would I?

00:05:18.336 --> 00:05:19.336
Aom.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.100
Aom.

00:05:22.754 --> 00:05:23.754
Aom, I’m sorry.

00:05:27.373 --> 00:05:28.545
Don’t lose hope.

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:33.589
I still have one more coin.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.080
Aom, look!

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:07.630
Let’s go.

00:06:20.922 --> 00:06:21.922
Aom.

00:06:24.522 --> 00:06:27.137
Don’t worry about what happened earlier.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:29.348
I won’t tell anyone.

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:33.139
Thank you.

00:06:46.146 --> 00:06:47.146
Samut.

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:48.890
What happened?

00:06:49.274 --> 00:06:51.600
I saw you and Aom fall back onto
the second floor.

00:06:52.247 --> 00:06:55.297
We fell to the second floor because
someone used a snake card in my room.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.348
The person who could do that was
someone who entered the room before.

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:01.810
Isn’t that right, Benz?

00:07:03.167 --> 00:07:04.167
What you looking at?

00:07:04.416 --> 00:07:06.400
I just used the card I got.
How’s that my fault?

00:07:06.813 --> 00:07:08.699
We almost got stuck here.

00:07:08.851 --> 00:07:09.382
Hey!

00:07:09.533 --> 00:07:11.614
I didn’t know the floor would collapse.

00:07:11.862 --> 00:07:14.300
One more thing,
I didn’t put you in that room.

00:07:14.608 --> 00:07:15.848
Blame your lucky star for that!

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:18.758
What you said isn’t wrong.

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.982
But I need you all to realize
how dangerous this game is.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.616
If you fall onto the collapsed floor,
you might not get another chance to play.

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:29.853
That’s why I want you all to have
a ladder card with you.

00:07:31.847 --> 00:07:34.653
Should I exchange for one now
in case of an emergency?

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.120
The machine on this floor is unlike
the one on the previous floor.

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:50.016
It looks like a vending machine.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:00.985
Look at the diagram.

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:04.300
The symbols on each floor are different.

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.158
The even-numbered floors have
a card exchange machine,

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:08.072
like the one on the second floor.

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:10.933
The odd-numbered floors
have a machine like this.

00:08:14.674 --> 00:08:16.402
These are all single-number dice.

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:18.460
What’s the point of having them anyway?

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:21.210
They’re useful if you know
which room you want to go into.

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:24.696
There’s a ladder card here, Mark.

00:08:25.508 --> 00:08:27.300
There’s also these
‘push’ and ‘pull’ cards.

00:08:28.445 --> 00:08:30.136
But how do we buy these items?

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:31.550
We do it here.

00:08:35.195 --> 00:08:37.398
So we roll our dice to buy items?

00:08:41.367 --> 00:08:42.653
Gotta try it to find out, huh?

00:08:50.866 --> 00:08:52.536
What? Only three?

00:08:53.333 --> 00:08:54.533
What can I even buy with that?

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:03.696
So we’re just relying on pure luck?

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:05.045
Sounds like fun, though.

00:09:05.631 --> 00:09:06.631
Let me try.

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:13.798
Nine?

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:16.102
One more point and I’d be able
to buy a ladder card!

00:09:16.918 --> 00:09:18.604
Just buy all the dice.

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:21.010
That will at least get you
to the fourth floor.

00:09:21.357 --> 00:09:24.496
From where you are right now,
this will get you to Room 32.

00:09:24.903 --> 00:09:27.617
I’ll buy a ladder card and
get you to the floor above.

00:09:27.872 --> 00:09:28.872
You will?

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.000
I told you I wanted to help you win.

00:09:32.632 --> 00:09:33.700
Thanks!

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:44.440
Samut.

00:09:44.662 --> 00:09:45.817
Can I talk to you?

00:09:48.921 --> 00:09:50.454
I have a plan I need your help with.

00:09:50.648 --> 00:09:51.648
How can I help?

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:56.847
I’ll use a ladder card in Room 31
to get to Room 50.

00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:00.752
Once on the fifth floor, I’ll buy
more items from the vending machine.

00:10:01.222 --> 00:10:04.656
I want you to use a ladder card in Room 51
to get us to Room 70.

00:10:05.114 --> 00:10:06.754
We’ll be on the seventh floor in no time.

00:10:09.616 --> 00:10:10.697
I think that might work.

00:10:12.081 --> 00:10:15.202
But wouldn’t it be better
if you work with Kaen?

00:10:20.668 --> 00:10:23.198
I don’t think he wants
to work with me right now.

00:10:24.831 --> 00:10:26.899
When I win and have my wish granted,

00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:29.896
maybe Kaen will forgive me
just a little, then.

00:10:30.299 --> 00:10:31.299
Alright.

00:10:31.755 --> 00:10:32.755
I’ll help.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.500
All players are accounted for.

00:10:47.568 --> 00:10:49.542
The card exchange machine
is now available.

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:11.053
I also got this room.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.240
Let’s do it.

00:11:25.328 --> 00:11:26.328
Hold on.

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:31.451
Did you hear that?

00:11:47.868 --> 00:11:48.868
- Aom?
- Aom?

00:11:59.951 --> 00:12:00.951
Is this…

00:12:01.189 --> 00:12:02.580
Is this Room 31?

00:12:02.912 --> 00:12:03.912
Yes.

00:12:04.343 --> 00:12:06.097
How did you get here?

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.336
What exactly do you want from Mark?

00:12:11.543 --> 00:12:14.005
I promised Mark I’d help him win...

00:12:14.022 --> 00:12:14.617
Liar!

00:12:14.697 --> 00:12:15.900
You’re overthinking, Pie.

00:12:16.465 --> 00:12:17.899
Even if you can help him win,

00:12:18.579 --> 00:12:20.056
I don’t want you to.

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:26.450
Pie used a push card on me.

00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:28.445
She pushed me into this room.

00:12:29.429 --> 00:12:32.201
That means a push card can place
a player in a room next door.

00:12:41.328 --> 00:12:42.328
Aom.

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:44.598
We’re going upstairs.

00:13:03.122 --> 00:13:06.502
Players, move the disks
into one of the rods.

00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:08.102
One disk may be moved at a time,

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:11.551
and do not place a bigger disk
on top of the smaller one.

00:13:12.066 --> 00:13:14.998
The player who is first
to finish moving the disks wins.

00:13:47.032 --> 00:13:48.032
Game over.

00:13:48.349 --> 00:13:50.505
Claim your prize in the hall.

00:13:56.103 --> 00:13:58.006
How come Aom and I are
the only ones who got coins?

00:13:58.030 --> 00:13:59.710
Mamay, you finished the puzzle,
didn’t you?

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:02.647
Maybe it was because I lost?

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:05.802
I think each room only has
prizes for two players.

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:08.859
You can see from the previous turns

00:14:09.185 --> 00:14:11.802
that there are rules the game
didn’t bother to tell us.

00:14:13.576 --> 00:14:14.957
Do you still have some dice?

00:14:15.737 --> 00:14:16.737
I have one.

00:14:18.488 --> 00:14:19.488
It’s alright.

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:21.045
I’ll use my dice to buy items.

00:14:21.462 --> 00:14:22.862
We’re still on track with the plan.

00:14:29.897 --> 00:14:31.705
Samut and Mamay must be
working together.

00:14:35.823 --> 00:14:36.823
Crap!

00:14:36.989 --> 00:14:38.902
There’s a vending machine
on the fifth floor.

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:42.152
I bet they’re buying ladder cards
and getting ahead of us.

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:43.968
I don’t think so.

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.626
I think the vending machine on
the fifth floor will only be available

00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:50.321
when all players are on the floor.

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:55.202
Games usually have their mechanism

00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:57.616
to make sure the players in the lead
don’t have too much of the upper hand

00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:00.040
by limiting their access to the items
in the vending machine.

00:15:01.845 --> 00:15:04.697
If that’s the case,
shall we join forces, too?

00:15:05.395 --> 00:15:07.155
How can I be sure
you won’t play dirty again?

00:15:08.364 --> 00:15:09.364
You can’t.

00:15:09.882 --> 00:15:11.922
But if you’re sticking to
rolling your regular dice,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.500
you ain’t winning this game.

00:15:16.242 --> 00:15:17.242
I’m not interested.

00:15:18.866 --> 00:15:20.801
Mamay is using Samut now.

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:23.062
But you can still be useful to us.

00:15:28.669 --> 00:15:29.669
Forget him.

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:31.510
We can do it with just the four of us.

00:15:34.017 --> 00:15:35.201
What do we do now?

00:15:36.134 --> 00:15:37.934
We need some ladder cards
to catch up to them.

00:15:44.971 --> 00:15:47.574
Maybe we need some snake cards
to slow them down?

00:15:47.731 --> 00:15:48.900
I used it once.

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:50.949
It works both ways.

00:15:52.271 --> 00:15:55.800
The chances of us getting the room
underneath them are slim.

00:15:56.225 --> 00:15:58.665
Whichever card you want, you need
two dice to exchange for it.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:02.120
Wouldn’t it be better to wait until
we get to the fifth floor and buy them?

00:16:02.244 --> 00:16:03.244
Idiot!

00:16:03.377 --> 00:16:05.937
By the time we get to the fifth floor,
they’ll be on the seventh!

00:16:06.066 --> 00:16:07.066
Benz.

00:16:07.634 --> 00:16:09.154
Where are the dice you bought earlier?

00:16:11.737 --> 00:16:12.398
What for?

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:12.928
Here.

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:14.410
Throw them in there.

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:26.770
Holy crap!

00:16:27.125 --> 00:16:29.054
Even the worst dice work.

00:16:29.964 --> 00:16:31.967
The rules only said we need two dice.

00:16:32.459 --> 00:16:33.703
It never said which ones.

00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:38.400
We can buy a bunch of dice and then
exchange them for a bunch of cards.

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:43.800
I’ve got a plan that will
catch us up to them now.

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:36.600
They’re gradually gaining on us.

00:17:38.906 --> 00:17:41.398
Should we wait for them?

00:17:41.834 --> 00:17:44.299
Maybe we do need to buy some items
from the vending machine.

00:17:46.773 --> 00:17:50.097
We still don’t know if all five of them
will get to this floor at the same time.

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:56.303
Aom, what are you thinking?

00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:00.296
I’m just thinking that
they’re unusually slow.

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:02.490
Since the previous turns,

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:05.300
it seems like they’re only proceeding
through one or two rooms.

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:12.740
We need to go upstairs
as soon as possible.

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:16.870
I think they know now that we can’t
buy items from the vending machine.

00:18:17.348 --> 00:18:20.802
Maybe they’re slow because they’re working
to amass their dice and cards.

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:23.254
Shall we hurry up and go, then?

00:18:25.103 --> 00:18:26.103
Alright.

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:51.749
Don’t you have two dice?

00:18:52.225 --> 00:18:53.595
Why did you only roll one?

00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:57.390
I’m waiting to buy some items
from the machine.

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:01.201
Let’s go on ahead, shall we?

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:20.697
I think Aom is actually waiting for Mark.

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:22.299
What do you think?

00:19:23.297 --> 00:19:24.401
That’s my suspicion, too.

00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:27.897
Aom didn’t show any signs of
interest in Mark before,

00:19:28.106 --> 00:19:30.002
but suddenly she’s approaching him.

00:19:30.634 --> 00:19:32.398
Don’t you think that’s strange?

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:35.650
You wouldn’t get it.

00:20:09.103 --> 00:20:10.103
So it’s you.

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:23.340
You must have fallen out of luck.

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:26.380
If you had gotten a lower number,
you wouldn’t have found yourself here.

00:20:27.521 --> 00:20:28.902
A push card is in effect.

00:20:29.084 --> 00:20:31.007
Choose the player you want to push.

00:20:33.001 --> 00:20:34.201
Go and climb your way back up.

00:21:03.354 --> 00:21:04.354
Samut?

00:21:10.685 --> 00:21:11.696
How did you get here?

00:21:12.354 --> 00:21:15.091
Someone used a snake card in Room 74.

00:21:15.103 --> 00:21:16.447
I fell through the floor into
the same room as Mark.

00:21:16.471 --> 00:21:18.700
He pushed me into Room 66

00:21:18.937 --> 00:21:20.702
and now I fell another floor down here.

00:21:32.905 --> 00:21:34.293
They must have planned this.

00:21:36.395 --> 00:21:38.699
We need to catch up.

00:21:39.684 --> 00:21:41.934
Samut, why don’t you use
your ladder card here?

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:47.720
No.

00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:49.351
I’ll keep it for now.

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:53.705
They can’t buy items on the seventh floor
anyway since someone’s still on the sixth.

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:01.004
We need to play the minigame
in this room first.

00:22:08.948 --> 00:22:09.948
Kaen?

00:22:11.514 --> 00:22:12.597
I knew it was you.

00:22:14.985 --> 00:22:17.299
Don and everyone can’t buy
any items right now

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:19.713
since the vending machine on
the seventh floor is still unavailable.

00:22:19.737 --> 00:22:22.902
But we need to get to the floor above.

00:22:23.014 --> 00:22:24.294
This floor is going to collapse.

00:22:24.862 --> 00:22:25.902
Right. We’ll do that.

00:22:26.194 --> 00:22:27.194
Let’s go.

00:22:30.343 --> 00:22:32.100
All players are accounted for.

00:22:32.422 --> 00:22:34.004
The vending machine is now available.

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:35.404
You’re slow.

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:37.500
We’re waiting for the machine to work.

00:23:12.088 --> 00:23:13.410
Your plan won’t work.

00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:17.290
What the hell are you saying?

00:23:17.654 --> 00:23:19.940
You bought those dice
so you could get to Room 71.

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:22.008
I can tell from the dice you bought.

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:24.684
Don in Room 65 bought a dice with
the number 6 on it.

00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:29.645
Mark in Room 67 bought a dice with
the number 4 and a ladder card.

00:23:30.802 --> 00:23:31.894
Benz and Pie did the same.

00:23:32.456 --> 00:23:35.198
You guys plan to go to Room 71
and then climb up to Room 90.

00:23:38.697 --> 00:23:39.697
So?

00:23:40.474 --> 00:23:42.514
Just ’cause you figured that out,
you can’t stop us.

00:23:42.568 --> 00:23:43.802
You don’t know this.

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:47.303
Each room only has two prizes.

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:52.290
If you proceed to Room 71
without any dice left,

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:56.002
you’ll be competing among yourselves
for only some people to proceed.

00:23:56.562 --> 00:23:57.562
I don’t believe you.

00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:00.549
What Samut said is true.

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:10.760
What are you doing?

00:24:13.075 --> 00:24:14.740
I’m also going to Room 71.

00:24:15.472 --> 00:24:18.299
We’ll be competing to see
who gets to move on, then.

00:24:19.462 --> 00:24:20.462
Hey.

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:22.880
Let’s hurry up.

00:24:28.277 --> 00:24:29.337
What do we do, Samut?

00:24:30.148 --> 00:24:32.050
They’re going to win at this rate.

00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:35.010
We still have a chance.

00:24:35.451 --> 00:24:37.100
Five people enter that room,

00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:39.294
but only two will get the prizes.

00:24:39.509 --> 00:24:41.069
That means someone will be left behind.

00:24:41.177 --> 00:24:43.297
That’s our window of opportunity
to get ahead of them.

00:24:46.706 --> 00:24:47.808
I’ll help you.

00:25:01.068 --> 00:25:03.890
I got Room 70, which is right
underneath the room they’re in.

00:25:04.171 --> 00:25:05.400
I’ll buy you some time.

00:25:07.727 --> 00:25:09.201
Why are you helping us, Kaen?

00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:12.497
You said you didn’t need my help.

00:25:14.272 --> 00:25:15.697
I just don’t want Don to win.

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:21.920
Thank you.

00:25:23.085 --> 00:25:24.085
No need to thank me.

00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:25.230
I’m doing this for myself.

00:25:30.662 --> 00:25:31.662
Hey.

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:35.780
I think I deserve to be the one proceeding

00:25:35.813 --> 00:25:37.330
since I bought us this card.

00:25:37.508 --> 00:25:38.700
How could you do this?

00:25:38.933 --> 00:25:40.007
We agreed!

00:25:40.271 --> 00:25:42.751
No one mentioned there’d be
no prizes for losers.

00:25:42.857 --> 00:25:44.296
Then let the game decide.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.700
If you lose, you don’t get to go on.

00:25:47.017 --> 00:25:48.853
What if you guys play dirty again?

00:25:49.059 --> 00:25:50.573
Hey, watch it.

00:25:53.657 --> 00:25:54.657
What are you doing?

00:25:58.995 --> 00:26:00.094
Crowd control.

00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:02.197
A push card is in effect.

00:26:02.555 --> 00:26:04.490
Choose the player you want to push.

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:07.840
Aom.

00:26:10.214 --> 00:26:11.703
You said you’d help me.

00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:13.410
I did.

00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:15.297
And I will.

00:26:23.068 --> 00:26:24.068
Aom!

00:26:25.477 --> 00:26:26.801
A ladder card is in effect.

00:26:27.576 --> 00:26:30.211
Please choose the room on the diagram.

00:26:32.954 --> 00:26:33.954
Don’t worry.

00:26:34.539 --> 00:26:36.102
I’ll help you win the game.

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:38.820
What a lucky bastard.

00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:41.346
It seems girls are fighting
to be helpful to you, huh?

00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:41.960
Buzz off.

00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:42.604
“Buzz off!”

00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:45.401
Mark, just choose the room
so we can play the game.

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:48.201
Don’t choose the wrong room, idiot,

00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:49.810
or we’d all be in trouble.

00:26:50.355 --> 00:26:51.355
What does that mean?

00:27:04.545 --> 00:27:06.171
We used a snake card in Room 70

00:27:06.754 --> 00:27:09.074
to prevent someone using another one
on us when we’re here.

00:27:25.274 --> 00:27:26.274
Sh...

00:27:36.531 --> 00:27:37.531
Aom.

00:27:37.910 --> 00:27:38.910
I’m almost done.

00:27:39.087 --> 00:27:40.087
You need to hurry.

00:27:40.127 --> 00:27:41.207
Don is almost done as well.

00:27:49.448 --> 00:27:50.448
Benz.

00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:55.780
What about me?

00:28:02.921 --> 00:28:04.320
Benz, what the hell did you do?

00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:08.620
I got it.

00:28:20.743 --> 00:28:21.300
Samut!

00:28:21.721 --> 00:28:22.804
Take a look at this.

00:28:29.982 --> 00:28:33.022
Don and his friends must use a snake card
in Room 70 and make Kaen fall down.

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:34.751
But what should we do?

00:28:35.245 --> 00:28:36.813
Kaen could be stuck here.

00:28:37.807 --> 00:28:38.807
A ladder card.

00:28:47.687 --> 00:28:48.687
Hold on.

00:28:50.232 --> 00:28:52.200
The sixth floor just collapsed, didn’t it?

00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:54.270
Yes.

00:28:54.970 --> 00:28:55.970
Why?

00:28:56.490 --> 00:28:59.696
So once everyone rolls
their dice this turn,

00:28:59.856 --> 00:29:01.056
this floor will also collapse.

00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:03.270
If we go to rescue Kaen on
the floor below in Room 51,

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:08.200
when we get back up to this floor…

00:29:21.411 --> 00:29:22.411
Damn it.

00:29:23.157 --> 00:29:24.658
This was all because of you,
Benz you jerk.

00:29:24.682 --> 00:29:26.060
Just shut the hell up, will ya?

00:29:30.931 --> 00:29:31.931
Pie!

00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:33.549
You meant to do that, didn’t you?

00:29:33.868 --> 00:29:35.697
You meant to separate me from Mark!

00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:37.354
Why are you mad at Aom?

00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:39.170
She was just playing along to the game.

00:29:39.503 --> 00:29:40.897
Are you taking her side, Mark?

00:29:43.069 --> 00:29:44.198
Stop being so crazy.

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:46.219
Why don’t you occupy your mind
with the game,

00:29:46.405 --> 00:29:47.697
instead of with a man?

00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:52.616
Aom!

00:29:52.635 --> 00:29:53.635
Pie!

00:29:53.682 --> 00:29:54.496
That’s enough.

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:55.899
Stop being so unreasonable!

00:29:58.536 --> 00:30:00.400
Everything I do is for you.

00:30:01.008 --> 00:30:02.597
But you don’t even care.

00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:07.930
Pie!

00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:09.350
Pie!

00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:11.590
Pie!

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:15.300
Pie!

00:30:16.309 --> 00:30:17.309
Pie!

00:30:18.290 --> 00:30:19.290
What should we do, Aom?

00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:24.905
Without the dice, I need to go back to
the same room and play the game again.

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:29.900
So I’m the only one with a dice now.

00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:33.470
I’m gonna go ahead
and finish the game, then.

00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:43.020
Crap.

00:30:46.804 --> 00:30:48.019
I’ll talk to Pie.

00:30:48.497 --> 00:30:49.699
I’m sorry about this.

00:30:50.515 --> 00:30:51.515
It’s alright.

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:54.702
Can y’all stop flirting for a sec
so we can play this game?

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:57.240
Damn your pretty face, you telephone pole.

00:30:59.105 --> 00:31:00.105
Let’s go.

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:02.320
Your girlfriend’s quite
the drama queen, ain’t she?

00:31:04.790 --> 00:31:05.790
Crap.

00:31:17.438 --> 00:31:18.438
Mamay?

00:31:21.795 --> 00:31:23.200
Did you get this room, too?

00:31:24.162 --> 00:31:26.100
I meant to get into this room to save you.

00:31:29.976 --> 00:31:31.297
We’re going upstairs.

00:31:56.390 --> 00:31:56.998
I…

00:31:57.070 --> 00:31:58.310
You don’t have to say anything.

00:31:59.885 --> 00:32:02.699
I believe that if you were in my position,

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:05.604
you’d do the same, too.

00:32:08.386 --> 00:32:09.386
Thanks.

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:18.100
But… hasn’t this floor collapsed?

00:32:18.882 --> 00:32:20.322
How are we going to get out of here?

00:32:21.955 --> 00:32:23.398
We’ll go to the ninth floor.

00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:35.102
Samut is waiting for us on the eighth floor
with a ladder card so he can get us out.

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:37.640
There’s another ladder Mark left
in the previous turn.

00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:40.302
That will get us up to the ninth floor.

00:32:43.758 --> 00:32:45.011
Mamay. Kaen.

00:32:45.752 --> 00:32:46.752
Come on up.

00:32:59.591 --> 00:33:02.302
Players, stand behind
your designated color slot.

00:33:02.586 --> 00:33:05.400
Whichever player the pin of the wheel
spins and stops at,

00:33:05.882 --> 00:33:08.139
that player is immediately eliminated.

00:33:08.773 --> 00:33:10.297
So it’s sheer luck?

00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:12.086
It’s got nothing else up its sleeves, huh?

00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:14.601
But the winner is more likely
to get to the finish line, right?

00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:23.860
Damn it!

00:33:24.077 --> 00:33:25.100
Curse my luck!

00:33:34.213 --> 00:33:35.213
Damn it!

00:33:35.878 --> 00:33:37.610
So it’s just Samut and Mamay.

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:52.360
Game over.

00:33:52.663 --> 00:33:54.795
Claim your prize in the hall.

00:33:58.330 --> 00:33:59.330
Let’s go.

00:34:00.288 --> 00:34:01.288
Let’s defeat Don.

00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:07.100
You go first.

00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:08.810
Roll a 10 and you’ll be
at the finish line.

00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:30.296
The Gate of Heaven is open.

00:35:30.398 --> 00:35:33.801
The first player to reach
the Gate of Heaven wins.

00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:03.200
Who the hell won?

00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:07.000
Here is the result of the game:

00:36:07.176 --> 00:36:10.306
The winner will receive one medal.

00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:21.090
Damn it!

00:36:26.503 --> 00:36:26.980
Mamay.

00:36:27.195 --> 00:36:28.195
Kaen.

00:36:28.287 --> 00:36:30.096
You were quick to finish your minigame.

00:36:30.798 --> 00:36:31.798
Quick?

00:36:32.509 --> 00:36:35.217
We took forever to complete it.

00:36:36.767 --> 00:36:40.503
Maybe time moves differently
in the game and in this room.

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:48.920
Don, my dude.

00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:51.354
Benz. Pie.

00:36:52.685 --> 00:36:53.685
Benz.

00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:56.552
You defeated Aom?

00:36:56.903 --> 00:36:58.202
Don’t sound so surprised.

00:36:58.751 --> 00:37:00.247
Aom was being stupid.

00:37:13.225 --> 00:37:14.225
Where’s Mark?

00:37:17.921 --> 00:37:18.921
Game over.

00:37:19.386 --> 00:37:21.703
Players can now leave the game.

00:37:21.748 --> 00:37:22.748
Wait.

00:37:23.183 --> 00:37:25.100
What do you mean, “game over”?

00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:27.030
Where is Mark?

00:37:27.371 --> 00:37:28.696
What happened?

00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:33.897
Mark couldn’t get to the finish line.

00:37:34.530 --> 00:37:35.247
That’s not true!

00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:37.054
He was ahead of us!

00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:39.469
He didn’t get enough points
when he rolled the dice.

00:37:39.493 --> 00:37:40.897
Don’t blame me for that.

00:37:43.859 --> 00:37:44.400
Aom.

00:37:44.857 --> 00:37:46.694
What does that mean for Mark?

00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:48.303
Will he be able to come back?

00:37:49.170 --> 00:37:50.170
Get out of my way!

00:37:51.454 --> 00:37:52.454
Mark!

00:37:53.004 --> 00:37:54.004
Mark!

00:37:54.515 --> 00:37:55.515
What should we do, Kaen?

00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:56.780
I don’t know.

00:38:03.965 --> 00:38:04.965
Aom.

00:38:05.810 --> 00:38:06.810
Where are you going?

00:38:09.754 --> 00:38:10.754
Pie, come on.

00:38:15.973 --> 00:38:16.973
Aom!

00:38:19.428 --> 00:38:20.428
Hold on!

00:38:21.459 --> 00:38:22.579
Where the hell is she going?

00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:35.720
I don’t see her anywhere.

00:38:36.896 --> 00:38:38.300
Me, neither.

00:38:40.548 --> 00:38:42.499
What should we do?

00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:50.050
Can you at least tell me
something believable?

00:38:50.518 --> 00:38:54.499
How could it be possible for a boy
to disappear because of a game?

00:38:55.451 --> 00:38:57.299
We swear we’re not lying, sir.

00:38:58.570 --> 00:39:00.997
Is that how you want me
to tell his mother?

00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:02.401
Think about it.

00:39:02.838 --> 00:39:06.302
You think I’d say, “Ma’am, your son
disappeared because of a game”?

00:39:06.825 --> 00:39:07.897
What do you mean?

00:39:08.924 --> 00:39:10.103
What did you say?

00:39:10.694 --> 00:39:12.100
Ma’am, please calm down.

00:39:12.654 --> 00:39:14.336
It’s best we don’t listen to these kids.

00:39:14.594 --> 00:39:19.598
I’m sure they’re making up things
in their heads.

00:39:19.795 --> 00:39:21.600
We most definitely are not!

00:39:21.986 --> 00:39:25.097
All of us here can testify that
there’s a game...

00:39:26.842 --> 00:39:27.842
I mean…

00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:30.700
There is a dice that
transports us into a game.

00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:32.800
Game…

00:39:34.013 --> 00:39:35.013
Dice…

00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:41.705
Is it a ten-sided dice with a moon on it?

00:39:44.641 --> 00:39:46.102
Do you know about it?

00:39:46.921 --> 00:39:48.294
How did you get your hands on it?

00:39:48.583 --> 00:39:49.703
What happened?

00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:53.148
Mark is stuck in the game
because of a girl named Aom.

00:39:57.740 --> 00:39:58.740
Aom?

00:40:00.942 --> 00:40:02.300
Did you say Aom?

00:40:06.302 --> 00:40:08.900
Do you know a girl named Aom, ma’am?

00:40:38.434 --> 00:40:39.434
Aom.

00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:41.847
Someone is here to see you.

00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:45.296
They’re waiting downstairs.

00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:49.560
Yes, Mom.

00:41:10.779 --> 00:41:11.896
What are you doing here?

00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:20.054
I came looking for you.

00:41:21.494 --> 00:41:23.000
The dice is with you, isn’t it?

00:41:24.825 --> 00:41:25.995
I threw it away.

00:41:26.536 --> 00:41:28.004
I told you it was dangerous.

00:41:28.330 --> 00:41:29.330
You know that.

00:41:30.934 --> 00:41:32.500
It’s not the game that’s dangerous.

00:41:33.330 --> 00:41:34.851
It’s the players.

00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:39.750
You made sure Mark was left behind
in the game, didn’t you?

00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:44.180
Why would I do what you
accused me of doing?

00:41:46.850 --> 00:41:48.854
Because you wanted to get back at me.

00:41:59.610 --> 00:42:00.610
Pan.

00:42:07.361 --> 00:42:08.361
Aom.

00:42:17.263 --> 00:42:20.164
You’re the student who disappeared
30 years ago, aren’t you?

00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:22.610
You meant to leave Mark in the game
as your revenge.

00:42:22.647 --> 00:42:23.796
This has nothing to do with you.

00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:24.408
It does.

00:42:24.574 --> 00:42:25.736
Mark is our friend.

00:42:25.795 --> 00:42:29.201
With more people, there’s a higher
chance of rescuing Mark.

00:42:29.739 --> 00:42:32.503
So I’m asking you if you want to join.

00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:35.948
We’re all here.

00:42:40.696 --> 00:42:41.696
Are you ready?
