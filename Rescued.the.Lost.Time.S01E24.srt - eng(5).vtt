WEBVTT

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.920
Wei!

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.560
Tang army has few outposts.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:48.360
Master.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.960
Master truly knows everything.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.490
Seems like the Firefly Map is all in your head.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.050
Let's go.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.120
Hya!

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.920
Yuyao slaves, you can't escape.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.920
I really didn't expect this.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.250
Zhaixing Hall hasn't trapped you two yet.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.890
I should have known.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.980
The Chen Jingbian we usually see is fake.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.560
The real Chen Jingbian suffers from severe headaches.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.200
He would never show himself in public.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.330
If I'm not mistaken,

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.480
he's in that carriage right now.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.840
Feng Yinniang, you are clever,

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.700
but not clever enough.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.880
Hurry!

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:30.960
You've been behind this all along,

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.400
threatening and holding Chen Jingbian hostage.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.000
What exactly is your scheme?

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.900
Zhuang Yao!

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.280
There is no scheme at all.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.720
I'm the one taking Chen Jingbian away

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.580
along with the Night Firefly Map.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.539
This has always been my open plan,

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:53.560
it's just that

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.640
you never figured it out.

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.560
If I had wanted you dead,

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.600
you would have been long gone by now.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.780
Zhuang Yao!

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.940
Why are you doing this?

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.240
Aqi and I,

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.600
and all those brothers who died,

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.620
we trusted you so much.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.200
We agreed

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.080
to plan together,

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.480
to live in seclusion in Chang'an together,

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.440
to restore the Great Tang together.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.960
What happened to our joint plan?

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.040
What about our promise to restore the empire?

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.700
Zhuang Yao!

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.640
You...

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:24.720
Why did you...

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.120
I was never

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.780
on your side to begin with.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.520
I've been following Lord Shi's orders,

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.920
hiding within the Tang army for a long time,

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.760
all to find from Chen Jingbian

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.210
the secret to controlling the Great Tang.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.720
We just had the same goal

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.490
and were temporary allies.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.640
So,

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.420
you're a spy for the rebel Shi Siming.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.240
Li Ling,

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.940
officially, we each follow our own masters.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:54.690
But personally,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.800
I truly considered you a friend.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.140
Given today's situation,

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.560
we can only meet as enemies now.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.330
Don't force me to fight you.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.120
From today on,

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:12.320
you and I

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:14.960
are no longer brothers.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.800
Don't think that because the Tang army recaptured Chang'an,

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.280
victory is assured.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.640
Once I deliver the Night Firefly Map to Lord Shi,

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.570
he will surely achieve greatness.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:25.280
You...

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.260
Master Zhuang,

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:27.520
do you really think

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.320
the Night Firefly Map is completely in your hands?

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.520
Why don't you look at Chen Jingbian in the carriage?

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.579
What state is he in?

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.560
This is exactly how I want him to be.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.400
Don't foolishly think you can understand the formula

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.000
by knowing the ingredients.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.880
You only know half the story.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.360
Though Tianshan Fire Poison can relieve pain,

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.800
long-term overuse

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.640
can lead to confusion and manipulation by others,

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:53.840
or worse, delirium

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.860
and death from poisoning.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.650
I'd like to ask you, Mr. Zhuang,

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.080
how can you be certain which of Chen Jingbian's words

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.840
are true

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.130
and which are false?

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.520
And how can you manage

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:05.520
to continue administering medicine

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.800
to prolong his illness

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.100
rather than sending him to his grave with a single bowl?

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:17.959
Miss Feng.

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:20.839
I truly admire you.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.090
Only you can use medicine with such divine skill.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.340
How about this?

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.060
Come with me to serve Lord Shi,

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.330
and we'll share wealth and prosperity together.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.420
What do you say?

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:32.440
Never.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.000
Lord Chen.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:36.970
Why don't you tell us

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.460
where that jade dagger given to Su Changming

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.080
came from?

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:44.520
And also,

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.760
who was it

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.659
who brought Feng Jianye's head and that precious sword

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.440
to you?

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:55.690
It was...

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.280
It was Li Ling.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.240
Officer Li.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.080
You're here.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.120
You killed the man.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.440
You delivered the head.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.200
This grand gift,

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.800
I gladly accepted it.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.320
You killed the man.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.600
You delivered the head.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.720
Li Ling, tell us,

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.760
Feng Jianye,

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.200
who really killed him?

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.760
Impossible.

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.400
Who really killed him?

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.660
How could this happen?

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.040
Li Ling, say something! Speak up!

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.400
You kept saying

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.159
General Feng's kindness to you was as great as mountains.

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:46.220
But what about you?

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.640
You did it for your own fame and fortune,

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.120
for your future career.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.880
Li Ling!

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.320
You're the real villain,

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.580
the murderer who kills innocent people.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:56.360
I didn't.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:01.920
Yin.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.040
There's no point in saying more.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.240
Take revenge.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:17.320
Kill him.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:18.970
Come with me.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:22.640
Why?

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.160
Why?

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:31.440
Do it now!

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:34.400
Li Ling.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.560
Brothers, charge!

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:48.040
Move in!

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.040
Retreat!

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.800
Brothers, our Guantian Society's motto is:

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.440
Cross mountains as if flying,

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.880
Cold winds carry golden sounds,

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.540
Crush those who don't know their place, grind their bones to dust.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.040
The antidote.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.860
We're not done yet.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.440
Don't die before you get the map.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:16.940
You don't know, do you?

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.480
You came to see me.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.320
He also came to see me.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.370
I care about my reputation.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.410
I was just messing with him.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:26.700
You went to see him.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.330
You also went to see him.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.200
Fine. Let's talk slowly.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:35.890
Let's go.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.200
Yin.

00:07:47.159 --> 00:07:47.760
I'm sorry.

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.770
I've been keeping something from you.

00:07:52.159 --> 00:07:53.760
I actually know your father.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:54.840
General Feng.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.620
If I hadn't met him,

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.520
there wouldn't be the Li Ling you see today.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.200
Don't kill me.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.480
Please spare my life.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.480
Here

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:15.280
is the Night Firefly Map.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.040
The Night Firefly Map.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.880
Father, Mother.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.140
Xiaochuan.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.740
I've finally avenged you.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:32.480
General Feng.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.760
I will take care of Yin Niang for the rest of my life.

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:49.800
Candied haws!

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.140
Candied haws for sale!

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.480
Come take a look!

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:53.720
Have a look!

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:55.970
Come and see what I have!

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.340
This campaign against Shi Siming

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.340
is the final battle to restore the Tang Dynasty.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.000
I don't know when I'll return.

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.320
A good man fights on the battlefield

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.520
and builds his career.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:12.920
Being homesick won't do.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000
If my father were here,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.660
he would certainly scold you.

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.380
Romance weakens a hero's spirit.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:20.320
[Li Ling bows]

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.400
If you don't leave soon,

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:22.800
I'll steal all the glory.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.000
If he dies,

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:27.490
will I have a chance?

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:27.920
You!

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:28.480
You rascal!

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:29.000
Fine.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.440
