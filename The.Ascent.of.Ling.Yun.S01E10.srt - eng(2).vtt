(The Way to Leave the Servitude Bureau)

00:00:21.267 --> 00:00:22.515
Give me some soap.

00:00:24.404 --> 00:00:25.280
Got it.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.720
Ling Yun.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.880
Madam wants

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.280
these clothes washed

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.160
before nightfall.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.200
You'll never finish

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.360
if you don't stop being sluggish.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.960
That's my own business.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.480
Stay out of it.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.376
Ling Yun.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.040
I know Ru Yi's death

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.520
deeply upsets you.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:53.720
But you can't

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.680
take your anger out on me.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.800
Ling Yun.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.080
Are you still holding a grudge

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.360
for how I mistreated you and Ru Yi?

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.160
I...

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.360
Ru Yi is gone.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.520
Why bother bringing it up?

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.440
Given our current situation,

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.880
we should focus on our duties

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.880
and try to get out of this place.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:16.768
That's what matters.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.760
I have no mind for anything else.

00:01:20.852 --> 00:01:21.716
I left it here.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.640
(Did this wretch)

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.160
(find a way to get out of here?)

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.480
(I'll see)

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:39.960
(what you're up to.)

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.472
Eunuch Tong An.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.760
I knew you'd pass by here at this hour.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.000
I'm waiting for you.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.320
Lady Ling Yun.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.168
What brings you here?

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.600
Please help me.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:01.824
Just this once.

00:02:02.432 --> 00:02:03.296
This is improper.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.360
Smuggling items into the palace

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.320
is a grave offense.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.160
If anyone finds out,

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.520
I'll be doomed.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.960
I'm in a desperate situation right now.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.496
Ru Yi

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.840
is gone.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.320
If I don't get out
of the Servitude Bureau,

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.080
I'll die there too.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.760
Please help me.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.720
There are people around.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.320
I'll be in trouble.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.968
I swear.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.080
Just this once.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.160
If you can get me out of there,

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.280
I'll remember your kindness

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.680
and repay you.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.600
You do sound desperate.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.960
Considering your ties with my master,

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.568
I'll help you once.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:43.872
Thank you.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.016
(This wretch)

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.920
(actually found a way to escape.)

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:50.176
(Fourteen Bureaus)

00:02:50.176 --> 00:02:51.264
Master.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.040
Ling Yun gave me money just now.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:58.600
It's...

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.400
Was it switched?

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:02.880
It was a bag of stones

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:03.960
to begin with.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.280
Return this to her

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.680
in private.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:13.760
Master.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.232
Doesn't it count

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.320
as an illegal exchange?

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.920
You're getting talkative lately.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.832
I spoke out of turn.

00:03:20.832 --> 00:03:21.880
Rest well, Master.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:22.848
I'll take my leave now.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.560
I'll make everyone respect me, fear me,

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.000
and bow before my authority.

00:03:34.624 --> 00:03:35.552
My lord.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.024
Either help me

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.720
become His Majesty's women

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.720
and win his favor

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:42.752
or

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.320
from now on,

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.920
we sever

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.712
all ties.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.624
This is going to be

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:52.680
an unknown path.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.880
I don't wish to burden you.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.440
Thank you.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.920
I will never forget

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.200
your kindness.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.480
Why do you need this pill?

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:15.800
I struggled

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.400
to acquire it outside the palace.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.160
I have eyes in Chengxi Palace

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.480
and I learned that

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.560
Consort Wan had been seeking this pill.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.320
She still resents me,

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.080
but if I offer her

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.080
this pill,

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.160
she'll surely be moved.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.720
Then I'll beg for her favor

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.560
to leave the Servitude Bureau.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:10.680
(Ling Yun.)

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:11.520
(Don't blame me.)

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.960
(I must seize the opportunity)

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.440
(to leave this awful place.)

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.760
Where is my brocade box?

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.040
Where is my brocade box?

00:05:30.048 --> 00:05:30.816
Stop.

00:05:31.616 --> 00:05:33.000
Did you take my brocade box?

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.048
Brocade box?

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.520
What brocade box?

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.440
I haven't seen it.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.000
That box means everything to me.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.880
Give it back.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:39.720
What do you want?

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.480
You can't convict someone
without evidence.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.160
You may not like me.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.440
But you shouldn't frame me.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.312
Give it back.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.480
Chief Wu has abandoned you.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:53.920
No one will protect you now.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.960
How dare you be so arrogant?

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.400
With such insolence,

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.840
you shall rot in the Servitude Bureau.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.160
I'll say it one last time.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.680
Give me back the box now,

00:06:05.328 --> 00:06:06.528
and I'll let this matter drop.

00:06:06.528 --> 00:06:08.280
Didn't you hear me?

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.880
I'll also say it one last time.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.600
I didn't take your worthless box.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.472
But

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.080
seeing you panic over losing it

00:06:16.256 --> 00:06:17.680
does give me some satisfaction.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.280
Cui Wei.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.640
Nothing is as simple as it appears.

00:06:21.952 --> 00:06:22.912
If I deliver the pill

00:06:22.912 --> 00:06:23.840
in that box,

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.080
I will be released.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.120
But if you do it,

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.600
you'll die.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:30.920
Arrogant fool.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.000
Spouting nonsense.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.232
Cui Wei,

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.080
don't say I didn't warn you.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.640
Staying here,

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.840
at least you'll survive.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.000
And there's hope.

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.080
But if you insist on leaving,

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.600
then you're heading to your grave.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.480
May you be free
from servitude in the next life

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.920
and live with integrity.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.120
Move.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.400
Ling Yun.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:19.680
Cui Wei said

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.040
she'd ask for a decree

00:07:21.152 --> 00:07:22.120
to leave here today.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.040
How is she

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.080
going to do that?

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.360
- If only we could
- Hurry up.

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:27.520
do the same.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:29.952
Don't envy her.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.880
Fortune and disaster are intertwined.

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.480
We'll see

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:34.680
how it ends.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:35.872
Silence.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.760
This is the Imperial Garden.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.000
Be quiet.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.600
His Majesty,
Consort Wan, and Consort Jing

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:44.640
are admiring flowers.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.280
If you disturb them,

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.880
your heads will roll!

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.640
- Understood.
- Understood.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:56.680
Consort Jing,

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.440
before I entered the palace,

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.200
my brother told me

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.080
to be friends with the fellow consorts

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.760
and serve His Majesty well.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.240
I unintentionally

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.080
offended you a few days ago.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.520
I beg for your forgiveness.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.320
No offense taken.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.640
I never dwell on trivial matters.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.680
We both devote ourselves to
serving His Majesty.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.400
We ask for nothing

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.880
as long as His Majesty is happy.

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:22.160
You're right.

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:23.488
Consort Wan.

00:08:23.488 --> 00:08:24.840
Consort Jing is magnanimous.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:25.840
Let bygones

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:26.800
be bygones.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.040
And your brother General Wansong...

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.320
Terrific.

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:32.280
He won

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:34.400
another battle at the border for us.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.720
His troops returned a few days ago.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:37.880
I've been contemplating

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.440
how to reward him.

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:40.680
Your Majesty,

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:42.120
I know little of state affairs,

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:43.480
but

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.680
it's been so long
since I last saw my brother.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.080
May I ask

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.760
Your Majesty

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:52.280
to grant permission
for my brother to visit me briefly?

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:53.568
Alright.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.880
Siblings tend to care for each other.

00:08:56.448 --> 00:08:57.480
I will host a banquet

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.680
in the Imperial Garden for your brother.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.880
You two may see each other then.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.320
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:11.744
(Ling Yun.)

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.120
(Now you can't escape.)

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:18.880
Move aside.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:29.960
Eunuch Shun Xi.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:32.960
May I humbly

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.080
request your assistance?

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:34.944
Well,

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:36.280
look who it is.

00:09:36.512 --> 00:09:37.216
If it isn't

00:09:37.216 --> 00:09:38.920
the convicted servant
of Fragrance Bureau,

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.192
Cui Wei.

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.280
This is a small token of my respect.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:43.760
Please kindly accept it.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.280
I possess a treasure
to present to Consort Wan.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.680
Her Highness will be delighted.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.000
Please convey this request to her.

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:59.280
Her Highness is admiring flowers
with His Majesty.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:01.600
How could she spare time for a convict?

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:02.920
Get lost.

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:05.640
Consort Wan.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:06.840
Consort Wan!

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.320
- This is urgent.
- How dare you!

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:09.408
- Consort Wan!
- Silence her.

00:10:09.408 --> 00:10:10.480
Consort Wan.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.128
I have a treasure for you.

00:10:12.128 --> 00:10:14.816
- Wu Linfu, take a look.
- I have a treasure for you!

00:10:15.347 --> 00:10:16.256
Understood.

00:10:16.256 --> 00:10:17.160
Consort Wan.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.080
Drag her out.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:18.944
Wait.

00:10:20.032 --> 00:10:20.992
Oh my.

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:22.240
Chief Wu.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:23.960
This servant is raving

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.800
and I was just expelling her.

00:10:26.784 --> 00:10:27.840
State your business.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:28.840
Chief Wu,

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.440
I'm offering Consort Wan a treasure.

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.480
She will be pleased.

00:10:32.512 --> 00:10:33.504
Is that so?

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:35.240
Then come with me.

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.760
May Your Majesty be well.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.120
May Your Highnesses be well.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.960
Why did you

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.960
bring this menial maid
before His Majesty?

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.024
Your Highness.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.800
I shouldn't have,

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.000
but this maid claimed

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.360
to have a treasure for you.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.160
I dared not dismiss her

00:11:04.448 --> 00:11:06.080
and allowed her to present herself.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.200
A treasure?

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.040
For me?

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:09.760
Your Highness.

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.000
I heard you seek this object.

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.600
I've obtained it after great effort.

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.480
That's why I boldly came

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:17.720
to present this.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:33.480
(The Asuji Pill?)

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:36.680
What's your name?

00:11:36.992 --> 00:11:38.080
I am Cui Wei,

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.640
a convicted servant.

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:40.920
I see. You may leave.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.960
Has Your Highness forgotten something?

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:47.640
Your Highness,

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.160
I obtained this treasure for you

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.680
in hopes of being freed

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.360
from the Servitude Bureau.

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.600
I beg your mercy.

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.560
I know. Leave us alone now.

00:11:56.672 --> 00:11:57.640
Thank you.

00:11:57.728 --> 00:11:58.880
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.080
Wait.

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:04.480
I saw a pill in that box.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:05.880
A pill from a maid

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:07.920
must be inspected even if it's precious.

00:12:08.416 --> 00:12:09.760
How naive you are

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:10.880
to accept it so readily.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:12.640
Your health matters most.

00:12:12.736 --> 00:12:13.720
Don't consume

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.000
unverified medications.

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:16.200
I'm also curious.

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:17.760
What pill could be so valuable

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:19.200
to earn your favor?

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:23.800
It's just a tonic pill.

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.080
I've been preparing tonic pills.

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:28.440
I only accepted this

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:29.960
to honor her goodwill.

00:12:30.912 --> 00:12:31.880
Consort Jing

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.160
knows herbalism.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.280
Let her examine it for you.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:36.960
Reward this maid

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:38.176
after we

00:12:38.176 --> 00:12:39.240
inspect the pill.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:40.928
Lv He.

00:12:45.728 --> 00:12:46.600
Your Highness.
