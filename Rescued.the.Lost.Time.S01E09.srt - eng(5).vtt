WEBVTT

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.920
Hey!

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.020
Go polish my knife.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.300
Polish it well.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.420
Yes, young master.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:53.640
Young master.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.880
She's probably tired from gathering herbs all day.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.760
Nongyu.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.530
Go and get some rest.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.220
My female apprentice.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.410
I don't have much to give you on our first meeting.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.320
Take this.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.360
As a welcome gift,

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.220
it's yours now.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.520
Young master,

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.320
be quiet!

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.050
Do you know what this is?

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.080
'Swift as flying over mountains.'

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.039
'The northern wind carries the sound of metal.'

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:28.280
The banner of the Eighteen Bandit Groups.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.400
The Commander's seal of the Guantian Society.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.320
With this item,

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.080
all three thousand brothers of the Guantian Society will follow your orders.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.410
Whatever you want done,

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.940
someone will do it for you.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.759
Anything at all?

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.140
Absolutely anything,

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.960
even killing someone.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.320
You really

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.420
shouldn't have taken that thing.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.120
Taking favors puts you in debt.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.680
This is such a huge debt to Su Changming.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.810
Do you realize that?

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.000
Actually,

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.730
everyone in the Guantian Society came from humble beginnings.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.800
Back when Su Tian'ao was alive,

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.240
they still followed certain principles.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.480
They robbed the rich to help the poor,

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.120
stood up for the weak against the strong.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.120
They often gave clothes and medicine to common people.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.130
But in Su Changming's generation,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I've heard they've become

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.400
honored guests of

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.000
officials and nobles in every prefecture.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.329
It's the classic case of officials colluding with bandits.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.440
In short,

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.570
you should stay as far away from them as possible.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.760
Don't get involved with them at all.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.600
Did you hear that?

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.200
Yes, I did.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:00.820
Come on, brothers.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:01.420
Cheers!

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.200
Cheers! Cheers!

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.600
Let's drink! Drink!

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.320
Drink up!

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.840
Come on, cheers!

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.440
Young master, I toast to you.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.300
Come on.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.200
Come on, come on.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.530
Come on, cheers! Drink!

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.800
Drink up!

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.400
Cheers!

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:22.890
Come on, cheers!

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.360
Young lady.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.520
What are you doing here?

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:57.800
Getting something.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:58.880
Getting things.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.160
Or are you missing a man?

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.760
Come here.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.180
What are you doing?

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:07.120
Young lady.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.180
What are you doing?

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.040
Let me go!

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.080
Something's wrong!

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.410
Something's happened!

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:18.010
What's going on?

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:20.680
What's happening?

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.920
What's wrong with this?

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:22.450
Zheshan.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.160
Young master.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.140
Who are you really?

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.240
Master Su.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.000
Stop! Spare his life!

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.520
This humble girl has offended the young master.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.440
Please forgive me.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.640
What's going on here?

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.810
What Guantian Society?

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.960
Just a bunch of bullies

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.400
who prey on women like beasts.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.730
I didn't, young master.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.160
Here is the society's command token.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.560
Didn't you say you could kill for me?

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.040
Young master.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.480
Young master.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.040
I want him dead now.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.320
Young master.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.400
Please don't, young master.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.320
Young master.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.160
Young master.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.280
Spare me, young master!

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:17.760
No!

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.080
Young master, please don't!

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.650
What I promised you,

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:29.850
I've fulfilled.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.650
The person you wanted dead,

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.920
I killed them.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.770
Let's go.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.840
Wait.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.570
I have one more request.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.840
Are you crazy?

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:47.360
What else is there to say?

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.890
Let's go.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.080
Let her speak.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.560
I want to join Guantian Society.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:53.820
I...

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.720
Now I'm a bit confused.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.320
I want to know where

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.660
this knife of yours came from.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.280
This thing is called Longgu.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.100
It originates from India.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.560
It has miraculous effects on treating knife wounds.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.480
Nongyu secretly added it

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.320
to Aqi's medicine.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.680
It took me quite some effort to find it.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:22.570
Get to the point.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.930
You know I don't understand medicine.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.860
In the Tang Dynasty, only Liangzhou produces this.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.560
Due to its miraculous effects,

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.760
local bandits have claimed it for themselves.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.680
It's rarely available on the market.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:35.540
In other words,

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.320
only their own people have access to it.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:39.920
Liangzhou.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:41.800
Bandits.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:43.820
Guantian Society.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:44.800
That's right.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.640
Guantian Society started as bandits.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.400
Their power has been growing recently.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.880
They shouldn't be underestimated.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.580
Now they're being courted by various factions.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.720
If Nongyu is really from Guantian Society,

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.880
then they must also have their eyes on

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.140
the Night Firefly Map.

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.360
Now we're in big trouble.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.000
Li Ling.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.120
Any news about the thief who broke into Zhaixing Hall?

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.080
Still no trace of him?

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.010
I've failed you.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.280
I'm afraid he has escaped.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.040
Whether we catch him or not,

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.000
I'm not in a hurry.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.120
But as the old saying goes,

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.320
It's not the theft that's worrying,

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.450
it's the thief's lingering interest.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.480
I'll assign more men right away.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:39.600
Go to Liangzhou.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:41.560
To Liangzhou?

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.840
I found a craftsman in Liangzhou

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.490
who made a special case for the Firefly Painting.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.680
Go and bring it back.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.860
I don't trust anyone else with this task.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:08.780
Officer Li is here.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.900
But Mr. Chen is looking for me.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.980
Have you ever heard of Guantian Society?

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:19.340
Guantian Society?

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:21.320
Never heard of it.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.400
Is that why you came to see me?

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.680
I need to leave the mansion for a while.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:32.640
While I'm away,

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.380
take care of yourself.

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:37.840
Why do I feel there's more to what you're saying?

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:40.240
You're not worried that as soon as you leave,

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.299
I'll steal from right under your nose

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.880
and take that Liuying Map, are you?

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.280
Of course I am.

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.320
I'm definitely worried.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.360
I'm scared too.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.600
The Zhaixing Hall is full of traps.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.800
I don't want to lose my life for nothing.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:56.920
This kind of thing

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.880
you'd better handle it, Officer Li.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.360
If you encounter any difficulties,

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.890
go to Jimin Pharmacy and find Manager Zhuang.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.440
I wouldn't dare trouble you all.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.840
I just want peace of mind.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:10.290
I'm leaving.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.810
If I had known it would be like this,

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.380
I should never have saved you.

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.560
Kids don't listen when they grow up.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.960
My daughter was just like that.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:41.860
But what happened?

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:43.120
Yanbo.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:44.200
Get out!

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.570
It's time to go, Nongyu.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:05.240
Nongyu.

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:07.400
Yanbo.

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.960
I've heard you mumbling in your dreams.

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.400
I don't know their names.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.520
So I made this blank memorial tablet.

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:24.020
At least it's something to remember them by.

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:27.040
If you miss them too much,

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.060
just light some incense for them.
