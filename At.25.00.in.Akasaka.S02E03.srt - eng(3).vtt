WEBVTT

00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.670
Let's break up.

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:03.630
Break up with Shirasaki.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.880
Thanks for everything.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.630
Goodbye.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.710
That was just an act.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.250
I have no intention of breaking up.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.540
You have to protect...

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:17.170
protect Shirasaki.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:18.750
And yourself.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.040
Shirasaki.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Want to move?

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.130
Huh?

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.250
Want to live together?

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:28.880
With me.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.830
Huh? B-But...

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.000
If we get caught...

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.710
Besides, Akeno-san will never agree.

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.000
I'll take care of Akeno-san.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.170
If it's a place with good security,

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:49.960
it'll be harder for paparazzi to get photos.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.420
It'd be safer than us going
back and forth to each other's places, right?

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:59.880
And...

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.040
we could be together all the time.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.040
Yeah.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:20.710
Yeah.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.130
This is so stylish.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:29.830
- Asami-san.
- Hmm?

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.670
You have something like this at your place, right?

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:32.750
I do.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.040
I don't have anything like this at my place.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.250
Ah.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.880
It's beautiful. So cool.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.380
Asami-san, this one.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.750
What do you think?

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.540
How does it feel to sit in?

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.750
It's perfect.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:49.880
Really?

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.750
Ah...

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:52.790
This is nice.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.830
Yeah.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.750
So we're going with this one?

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.830
Okay.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.580
I can't believe it.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.460
We're actually going to live together.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.960
Hold on tight.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.080
Okay.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.420
Okay.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.710
Is this the last box?

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:21.830
Yes.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.750
This place is bigger than I thought.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.580
Well, my bed took up most of the space before.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.330
This was the first ordinary room
I rented after coming to Tokyo.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.540
But...

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.960
it's filled with so many memories.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.710
This will also be the last time
Asami-san comes to this room.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.460
Yeah.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:12.670
Um...

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.290
Every time you came here, Asami-san,

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.920
it made me feel like all my past struggles
had finally paid off.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.630
Every day that you visited

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.880
was a special day for me.

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.290
Do you...

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.500
not want to move?

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.250
No, that's not it.

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:18.670
It's just that so much has happened here.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.330
The next place...

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.080
will become just as special in no time.

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:49.210
"At 25:00, in Akasaka" Season 2
(Episode 3)

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.330
Good work today.

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.920
I'm so glad you were able to move.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.130
I was always worried about
the security at your old apartment.

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:52.250
Sorry about that.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.630
I also spoke with Akeno-san.

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.540
As long as you're happy, Shirasaki,

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:04.920
I'll support you quietly.

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.080
Thank you.

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.790
The rent is higher, so I'll have to work harder.

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:14.290
Right.

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:16.250
Here.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:17.920
What's this?

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.290
The play, "Rain and Confession".

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:21.960
The director is Aoyama Ruiichiro.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.000
That's right, the Aoyama-san
who's won countless theater awards.

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:27.670
Please, tell me more.

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:28.630
Aoyama-san...

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.170
He's always worked exclusively with veteran actors.

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:33.960
I heard he's holding auditions
for the first time in ten years.

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.920
Alright, that's all for today.

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:42.630
Akeno-san.

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:47.080
What does my schedule look like
around this fall?

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:52.250
We're currently in talks for one TV series
and one single-episode drama.

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:53.960
There's also a film offer.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.960
But we haven't responded to it yet.

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.290
Why do you ask?

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:08.920
This.

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:11.380
I want to audition for this.

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:19.040
"Rain and Confession".

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:21.630
What kind of story is "Rain and Confession"?

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:25.380
The original work is a novel
by Kogure Prize-winning author Ogikubo Satoshi.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:30.580
The protagonist commits murder
and impersonates the man he killed.

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:34.750
It's a work that depicts human desire and tragedy.

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:37.630
Like "Purple Noon"?

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:39.380
Yes...

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:40.540
Sounds interesting.

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:41.920
There are only four actors in the entire cast.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.710
I hear that regardless of experience,

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.750
everyone will be chosen
through the same audition process.

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:46.920
Shirasaki.

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:47.750
What do you think?

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:48.960
- I'll do it.
- So decisive.

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.000
I want to be on Aoyama-san's stage.

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:52.580
Please let me audition.

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:57.960
I understand you want to do this play.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:02.210
But... for Hayama right now,

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:04.790
is this really necessary?

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:08.290
Rehearsals will take over a month.

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:10.710
On top of that, there's the show itself
and the regional tour.

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:12.710
That's three months in total.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:14.420
During that time,

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:17.170
you won't be able to take on any other jobs.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.460
Even so, I want to do it.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:27.230
Because I believe this is something
that's necessary â€‹for me right now.

00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:36.460
I understand.

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:38.500
I'll adjust your schedule.

00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:42.080
Thank you.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.170
("Rain and Confession" by Ogikubo Satoshi)

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:39.540
Asami-san.

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:40.960
Can I get some help?

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:42.790
Yeah.

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:48.170
Shirasaki.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:50.210
Did you know they have furniture assembly services?

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:52.330
Asami-san, please get the other side.

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:53.790
- Yeah.
- For stuff like this,

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.790
you can just ask the company,
and they'll send someone to build it.

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.750
Please fit it in there.

00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.710
Not here, over here.

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:02.040
Sorry.

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:04.630
Okay.

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:06.040
That's good now.

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:08.420
Okay.

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:09.920
Next up is...

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:12.540
Use screw A...

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:17.380
to connect the side panel and the bottom panel.

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:19.420
This is it, right?

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:21.830
Which one is the screw?

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:25.920
Come on, help me.

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.880
I am helping.

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:29.670
Do you enjoy this?

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:31.250
Assembling things.

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:33.830
It's not that I like or dislike it.

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:37.420
With two people, stuff like this
gets done in a flash.

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.880
You just naturally assumed
I'd be helping, didn't you?

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.540
Isn't that a given?

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:46.250
Besides, you'll be using it too, Asami-san.

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:51.790
"Using it" isn't quite the right word.

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.040
Huh?

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.250
It's nothing.

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:58.420
You'll let me borrow it sometimes, right?

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:07.830
Jeez.

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:10.750
We'll never finish this.

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:16.000
This way, even in Shirasaki's room,

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:18.920
we can do all the naughty things we want.

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:21.580
All we want.

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:29.250
Then let's hurry up and build this.

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:31.880
Suddenly, you're motivated.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.420
So where were we?

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:36.380
We just finished step six.

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.630
Use screw A...

(Stage Play "Rain and Confession"
Second Round Auditions - Waiting Room)

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:49.040
Morning.

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:50.830
Morning.

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:07.170
You're Shirasaki-san, right?

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:08.580
Yes.

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:12.040
I loved you in "Daydream".

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:15.750
I've always hoped I'd get to act with you someday.

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:17.000
Thank you.

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:18.710
My name is Kuroki Keita.

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:20.380
I'm Shirasaki Yuki.

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:40.790
I wonder how many people will pass this second round.

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:43.500
I have no idea.

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:46.880
I heard there were about two thousand applicants.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.170
What?

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.540
That many?

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:53.830
But it seems the auditions aren't just today.
They'll continue tomorrow as well.

00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:01.130
Will numbers 16 through 20 please
proceed to the audition hall.

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:02.210
Yes.

00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:09.880
Excuse us.

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:11.790
Good morning.

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:13.380
Good morning.

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:14.750
Good morning.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.040
Good morning.

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:20.880
Please, have a seat.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.790
Thank you.

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:35.290
I'm the producer, Nozawa.

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:38.380
Thank you all for coming today.

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:42.580
For the protagonist, the core of this production,

00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:47.080
we are looking for someone who can portray complex emotions
with both subtlety and strength.

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:48.250
Most importantly,

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:50.500
we hope to find someone
who can share in Director Aoyama's passion

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:54.920
and build this play together.

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:57.420
We look forward to your performances.

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:01.630
Let's begin with self-introductions.

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:03.830
Number 16, Mr. Kuroki.

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:05.290
Yes.

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:13.710
I'm Kuroki Keita.

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:20.330
I plan to make this project
my signature role.

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:25.460
I hope to connect with the main character,
Muroga Jun, more deeply than anyone.

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:27.170
His loneliness and his vulnerability.

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:29.710
I want to get closer to him than anyone else.

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:35.080
My name is Keita.

00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:37.750
The "Kei" in my name means firefly.

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:43.750
But unlike a firefly, I don't shine,
and I'm often overlooked.

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:47.460
I hope that like a firefly,

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:48.920
even if it's just a little,

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:52.170
I can light a spark in someone's heart.

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:53.920
Thank you for your consideration.

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.290
Thank you.

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:05.040
Next, number 17, Mr. Shirasaki.

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:06.540
Yes.

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:17.040
I'm Shirasaki Yuki.

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:24.880
The reason I wanted to be in this production

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:30.960
is because I learned the director is Aoyama Ruiichiro.

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:35.830
The first...

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:37.170
Um...

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:39.250
After I came to Tokyo,

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:41.670
the first play I ever saw

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:44.170
was Mr. Aoyama's "The Silent Spiral".

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:50.460
I was completely blown away.

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:56.000
I hope that,

00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:59.040
together with Mr. Aoyama,

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:04.500
I can help shape and
bring the character of Muroga Jun to life.

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:07.210
Thank you for your consideration.

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:15.420
Thank you.

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:18.000
Alright, number 18, Mr. Inoue.

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:19.250
Yes.

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:24.130
Thank you.

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:28.250
That concludes today's auditions.

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:29.830
Could you wait a moment?

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:34.080
Mr. Kuroki, and... Mr. Shirasaki.

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:37.250
Could you show us a little more?

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:38.500
Huh?

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:43.500
- Well... how about a little improv?
- Yes.

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:44.710
There's no script,

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:47.210
but I'd like you two to play Muroga and Mitarai.

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:48.460
Okay.

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:50.670
Okay.

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:54.000
Then I'll play Muroga.

00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:56.000
And you can be Mitarai.

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:57.920
Excuse me.

00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:00.330
Could you please try to imagine

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:03.420
and act out a scene that isn't in the script?

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:05.330
- Yes.
- Okay.

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:07.420
- I look forward to working with you.
- Same here.

00:17:07.830 --> 00:17:08.960
Here we go.

00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:10.920
And... action.

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:16.540
It's been... two years, hasn't it?

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
Two years already...

00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:21.540
Mitarai.

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:26.040
When I first came to this village,

00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:28.290
do you remember?

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:36.750
I'm home.

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:38.540
Welcome back.

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:40.960
Huh?

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:44.040
What are you doing?

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.380
Making your favorite gyoza.

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:48.790
Awesome!

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:50.420
Let me help.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.380
The meat...

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:01.790
Is that all you're putting in?

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:04.880
They're better with mostly vegetables.

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:10.250
Sorry.

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:12.670
Can you get the oyster sauce from the fridge?

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:13.920
Hmm?

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.540
As you can see,

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:18.420
my hands are a little full right now.

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:28.290
Even if you try to sweet-talk me like that,

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:30.670
there's nothing I can do.
You're putting me in a tough spot.

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:33.920
But your mouth is free, isn't it?

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:42.920
Hey, stop it...

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:44.830
That tickles.

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.960
If you don't help wrap, you don't get to eat.

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:50.130
Fine...

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:51.750
Oyster sauce, right?

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:52.880
Yeah.

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:02.420
Time to eat.

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:03.790
Go ahead.

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:12.580
These are delicious with mostly vegetables.

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:16.380
You have a unique way with compliments.

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:18.920
Delicious.

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:23.500
They really are.

00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:28.880
Cheers.

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:41.330
This is nice, though.

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:44.080
Hmm?

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:47.250
Now that you've moved,

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:50.750
I'm so happy we can see each other anytime.

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:04.540
Everything's so good.

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:12.460
Oh.

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:13.670
Good work today.

00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:15.000
You too.

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:16.040
Are you here today for...?

00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:17.880
An interview for a drama series.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.630
Um... do you mind if I sit here?

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:22.080
Of course, please do.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.920
Thank you for taking such good care of our Shirasaki.

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:32.460
I should be the one saying that.

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:37.790
Ever since he worked with Hayama-san
on "Daydream",

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:40.460
Shirasaki has really grown as an actor.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.170
It seems they've had
a great influence on each other.

00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:57.960
You know, Hayama...

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:02.250
almost never complains about work.

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:02.960
Is that so?

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:03.830
Yeah.

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.290
He's been like that since his modeling days.

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:08.830
Whatever job comes his way, he takes it.

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:11.880
And once he takes it, he gives it his all.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.330
That's impressive.

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.210
However,

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:18.330
the one time he decided to take on an acting job,

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:21.130
was the rare occasion he asked for it himself.

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:23.630
Alright, that's all for today.

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:25.210
Good work.

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:26.880
Yes.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.880
Akeno-san, um...

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.290
Yes?

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:43.130
I want to try acting.

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:51.170
And now,

00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:53.170
he's the lead in a drama series.

00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:56.250
He's really a blue-chip talent, isn't he?

00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:58.170
That's a strange way to put it.

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:03.000
Good morning.

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:04.080
Actors auditioning for Mitarai,

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:07.790
please wear this name tag on your chest
before entering the waiting room.

00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:09.580
Good morning.

00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:10.960
I'm Shirasaki Yuki.

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:12.670
Okay, actors auditioning for Muroga,

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:15.790
please wear this name tag on your chest
before entering the waiting room.

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:17.130
Okay.

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:20.920
Yes!

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:27.750
Good morning.

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.460
Shirasaki-san.

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:34.130
Oh... hello.

00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:36.580
I knew we'd meet again.

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:39.920
Let's do our best in the third round.

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:41.500
Let's.

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:44.500
Hey, isn't that Shirasaki?

00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:46.330
Sakuma-san...

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:48.380
So you're auditioning too.

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:51.170
Are you also here
for the role of Muroga, Sakuma-san?

00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:53.580
No, I'm trying out for the role of Fukuyama.

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:55.750
See? The color is different.

00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:57.330
You're right.

00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:59.880
I hope we can perform on stage together.

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:02.670
Yeah.

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:03.630
Look.

00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:05.580
Wait...

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:06.920
He's here too?

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:07.960
No way.

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:09.290
You've got to be kidding me.

00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:12.040
What are we gonna do?

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:29.380
(This story is a work of fiction.)

00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:31.960
(Next Episode)
The acting evaluation will proceed in numerical order

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:33.630
in pairs of two.

00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:36.670
No, that's not what I was thinking.

00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:37.880
No.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.540
Are you trying to get in my way too?

00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:42.380
Asami-san.

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:44.330
Until this audition is over,

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:46.130
could you please keep your distance?

00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:48.500
I don't want to lose to you, Asami-san.

00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:50.500
Asami-san, what are you...

00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:52.210
thinking?

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:55.750
I want to touch Shirasaki.

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:57.000
Hayama.

00:23:57.130 --> 00:23:58.500
This audition...
