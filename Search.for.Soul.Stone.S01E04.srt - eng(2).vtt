Shaoye

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.960
It's not that I won't say it

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:53.320
I really didn't see anything

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.759
I just remember there was someone

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.840
No, that wasn't a person

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
It was a monster

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.960
He had no arms

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.679
A blade grew out from his arm

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.039
A blade

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.000
Shaoye

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.599
That monster is right behind you

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.120
Xiao Duo, run

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.200
Run!

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.200
Aren't you good at running?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.519
Xiao Duo

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Hide behind me, quick

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.719
The boss specifically said

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.080
to catch them alive

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.039
But didn't say how alive

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:16.479
What does that even mean?

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:17.719
Nine-tenths alive

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.520
Seven-tenths alive

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:19.759
Five-tenths alive

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:21.000
Or both alive

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:22.479
One alive counts too

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.800
What do you mean by that?

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.199
Salute me

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:33.000
No need to be so polite

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.759
At most

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.400
I'll just cut off both your legs

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.759
So you can't run anymore

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:42.439
Xiao Duo

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.800
Xiao Duo

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.319
Stop!

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.479
I said stop!

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.879
Xiao Duo

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.039
You think

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.199
that thing of yours can hurt me?

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.520
Looks like I underestimated you

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.400
But if I switch to this

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:18.400
How will you handle that?

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.400
If you move again

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:25.599
I'll kill him

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:34.199
Want to see who's faster?

00:04:37.519 --> 00:04:38.199
Miss

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:39.600
Dao Lang has already been locked up

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.600
Got it

00:04:48.399 --> 00:04:49.439
All these years

00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:51.839
How did you get by?

00:04:53.519 --> 00:04:54.879
How else could we live?

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.399
Eat when there's food

00:04:58.759 --> 00:04:59.839
If there's none

00:05:00.079 --> 00:05:00.800
Go earn some more

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.399
Let me tell you

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.439
The two of us were quite something

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:14.120
We'd fish coins from the claw machine

00:05:17.959 --> 00:05:20.399
Stuffed rocks to trick the junk dealer

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:23.920
Sometimes when it rained

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:26.199
There were barely any people outside

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.480
Couldn't find any bottles to pick up

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.560
We had to steal from the supermarket

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:34.240
Sir

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:36.000
That yellow pack of cigarettes behind you

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.879
How much is it?

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.399
That's thirty

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:42.800
Oh, thirty

00:05:43.959 --> 00:05:45.240
Thanks, sir

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.879
Kid

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:52.680
Your sister is still young

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.959
Promise me

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.079
Don't let her do this again

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:00.879
Turns out the old man always knew

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.600
we were there to steal

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.560
I finally understood

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:16.160
I can't let Xiao Duo

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:19.439
live like a sewer rat forever

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:21.720
I want to take Xiao Duo

00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:23.279
and live with dignity

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:26.240
to make up for our past mistakes

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.480
Give Xiao Duo a normal life

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:33.759
With my power

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.439
I'll do what a Meng Jia member

00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:37.319
is meant to do

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.120
I'm not human

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.079
I'm lazy and greedy

00:06:42.959 --> 00:06:43.759
Darn it

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.360
I shouldn't steal

00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:49.120
Your power keeps growing

00:06:49.959 --> 00:06:51.759
Making money shouldn't be hard

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.079
Before I'm strong enough

00:06:55.839 --> 00:06:57.560
I can't reveal my power

00:06:58.319 --> 00:06:59.639
and put us in danger

00:07:00.839 --> 00:07:03.920
Nor break the rule that the Gifted

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.160
must stay hidden from the world

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.759
No wonder all these years

00:07:08.759 --> 00:07:09.959
we couldn't find you

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.240
Until I can face the real culprit

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:16.839
I have to keep hiding

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:23.600
Yuer, your hand

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:41.519
Meng Yan

00:07:42.519 --> 00:07:43.800
That day at Meng Jia

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.560
what really happened?

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.639
A lot of people tried to catch me

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.920
I didn't know who they were

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.079
According to A-Q and Dao Lang

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.199
I suspect it was Shen Tianyi

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.319
Shen Tianyi

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:06.959
I guessed it was him long ago

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.920
How did you know?

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.319
After your family fell

00:08:15.079 --> 00:08:16.000
Shen Jia took over

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.639
all of Meng Jia's jade veins

00:08:18.519 --> 00:08:20.839
Now the jade king of Myanmar

00:08:21.079 --> 00:08:23.319
is no longer Meng Jia, but Shen Jia

00:08:24.439 --> 00:08:26.279
Most of the jade on the market

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.319
is in Shen Jia's hands

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:31.480
But strangely

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:34.679
when jade is sold from Shen Jia

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.200
most of it has lost its energy

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.120
Training the Gifted does require

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.600
a lot of energy from jade

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.120
But having too much is pointless

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.120
What does he want?

00:08:47.399 --> 00:08:48.679
Some guess

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.320
he's secretly practicing some dark art

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:52.919
Others think

00:08:53.399 --> 00:08:54.399
he's recruited

00:08:54.399 --> 00:08:56.200
many Gifted to serve him

00:08:56.919 --> 00:08:59.639
I already sent the Azure Dragon Gang to investigate

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:01.720
But

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.120
there's no clue yet

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:07.799
Miss

00:09:08.159 --> 00:09:09.399
Dao Lang cut off his own arm

00:09:09.399 --> 00:09:11.279
broke free and escaped

00:09:19.639 --> 00:09:21.440
You actually came back like this

00:09:21.879 --> 00:09:22.840
I failed you

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:36.919
You've worked hard

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.399
Get some rest

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:40.919
Thank you, sir
