WEBVTT

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.920
Hey!

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.280
Don't be afraid, Rui.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.080
No matter how fierce those people look,

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.560
they can't hurt us, right?

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.240
Luan, let's go.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.040
I want to leave this place

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.320
with you and Mother, just the three of us.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.610
Where would you like to go, Rui?

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.400
Mother told me

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.560
her hometown is in Weizhou.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.330
It has the bluest skies in the Tang Dynasty

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.920
and sheep as white as snow.

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:16.360
Alright, be good, Rui.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:17.970
Get some more sleep.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.480
When you wake up, we'll set off for Weizhou together.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.960
Okay?

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.130
So you're saying

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.570
they're using your son to force you

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.050
to do their bidding?

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.840
So

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.890
you've been Wei Cheng's person all along.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.720
I have nothing left now.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.690
I'm begging you to find a way

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:50.490
to save them.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.000
I know

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.200
you two are not ordinary people.

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:55.400
Nongyu.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.800
Haven't you always been saving others?

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.200
Please find a way to save them too, will you?

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.480
I...

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.160
I'm kowtowing to you.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.200
Please save them.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.420
Don't kneel, please don't kneel.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.960
It seems now

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:12.720
there's only one solution left.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.760
Master.

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:22.920
Nongyu.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.360
These past two days,

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.800
you've been treating our family's illness

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.690
and also tending to that person's wounds in the dungeon.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.450
You've really worked hard.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.920
Let me ask you,

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.800
is there any medicine in this world

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.360
that when taken

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.160
can make someone tell the truth?

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.120
Master, you must be joking.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.579
How could such medicine exist in this world?

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.000
However,

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.650
are you troubled by that criminal?

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.960
Could it be

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.480
you have some method?

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.560
Your official matters,

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.360
I dare not speak carelessly about.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.420
Feel free to speak.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.480
I...

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.160
I just feel that

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.960
that criminal now only wishes to die

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.980
so he can leave his name in the history books.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.960
Eager to die?

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.280
Dream on.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.940
I just remembered something.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.090
There was this situation back in my hometown.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.200
The village butcher,

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.040
his wife was a real shrew.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.040
Relying on her wealthy family background,

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.100
she would either beat or scold the butcher all day long.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.890
One time things got really bad,

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.160
she stomped her foot and went back to her parents' home.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.360
Guess what happened?

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.420
Don't keep us in suspense.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.440
Her family not only refused to help her,

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.960
they scolded her for not being a proper wife,

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.240
gave her a severe beating,

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.570
and sent her right back.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.400
From then on, that woman

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.760
became as obedient as could possibly be.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.800
Nongyu, oh Nongyu,

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.360
you really are my clever little darling.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:20.680
Useless fool!

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.500
You failed your mission and still have the nerve to face me?

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.680
This Li Ling is extremely cautious.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.000
I wanted to make a move,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.600
but I needed an opportunity.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.080
I...

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.370
I have something else to report to you.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.880
What's this?

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.240
It's a pass token for the Chen mansion.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.770
I had a hard time getting it.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.480
Right now, everyone in the Chen mansion

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.480
is busy dealing with the spy matter.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.960
The old eunuch's attention

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.620
isn't focused on this either.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.300
If we want to steal the map,

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.440
now is the perfect opportunity.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.760
If we get the map,

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.240
it would be a great achievement.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.040
Manager Wang, your future would be limitless.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.210
Do you think I'm stupid?

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.200
That Zhaixing Hall is full of traps.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.480
Even if I can enter the Chen mansion,

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.540
I still can't get into Zhaixing Hall.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.320
So what use is this thing?

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.240
People coming and going from the hall

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.900
makes it truly inconvenient.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.440
But when they need to use it,

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.240
they'll definitely take it out.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.360
Yesterday, on the desk in Chen Jingbian's study,

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.920
I saw a curious small wooden box.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.090
I guarantee you,

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.480
that must be the Night Firefly Map.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.720
Really?

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.330
The fish has taken the bait.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:42.850
I'm not certain.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.720
But to kill two birds with one stone,

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.980
I have to take the risk.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.360
But this plan involves more than just you and me.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.760
There's also Pang Shiyuan.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.090
You trust her that much?

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.740
Have you ever heard her play the xiao?

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.780
I didn't know Officer Li appreciated music.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.840
What I mean is,

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.000
I never understood before

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.260
where the sadness in her music came from.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.810
Until I heard her talk about her child.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:15.940
I trust her.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.160
And I trust you even more.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.380
Your wounds are healing well.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.130
Take good care of yourself.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.780
I'll go get your medicine.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:37.980
Come. Dinner's ready.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.240
Hurry up.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.170
It's time to eat.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.240
We're here to rescue you.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.400
Prison break!

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.380
Hurry! Someone come quickly!

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.159
Looks like he doesn't have many days left.

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:55.920
Neither of us can escape if we carry him.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:56.880
Sorry, young man.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:57.800
The orders from above were clear.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.400
If we can't rescue you, we leave no body behind.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:08.720
He's not dead.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.320
You want to be a hero.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.440
But they've tossed you aside like an old shoe.

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.440
You've suffered so much physical pain for nothing.

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.320
Even I feel sorry for you.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:33.600
Boy.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.560
I can see you're a man with spirit.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.440
If you just cooperate,

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.280
wealth and glory

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.200
will all be yours.

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.420
Nice performance.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.400
We'll come to rescue you.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:57.400
Don't fall for it.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.520
But I could smell your fox stench

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.000
from a mile away.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.370
You dare bite me?

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.440
I'll kill you!

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:08.970
Not good.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:09.800
It's Zhaixing Hall.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:10.660
It's the study.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:11.560
Go.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.240
Damn it.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:15.920
This way, this way.

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:16.520
Over here.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:19.250
That way.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:24.560
Hurry up.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:25.760
Seal all the doors.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.120
The rest of you follow me.

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:27.720
Yes.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:33.679
Take this.

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:36.440
Why aren't you taking it?

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:45.240
Officer Li, we couldn't find them.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:45.900
Officer Li.

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:47.440
Nothing here.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.690
All of you go search over there.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.660
Did you catch them?

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.600
If Manager Xie couldn't catch them,

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.060
how could I possibly do it?

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:58.840
Useless fool.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:08:59.960
Come with me.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:00.440
Yes.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.210
Take this first.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.000
Why are you giving me this?

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000
How can you run while holding this?

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:16.720
Take it for now.

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.240
Find a chance to give it to Lord Wei later.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:18.560
I...

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:19.360
You...

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:25.080
They've searched every corner of the mansion.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.560
Could they have grown wings and flown away?

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.290
One manager and one attendant.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.720
What use are you all to me?

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.740
It's my incompetence.

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.300
I've failed you, Sir Chen.

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.080
Officer Li.

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.410
Don't be so quick to apologize.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.480
When the thief was stealing,

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.040
the master and I were interrogating prisoners in jail.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:42.840
Only you

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.780
were patrolling outside.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.040
If you hadn't neglected your duties and missed the opportunity,

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:49.720
how could that thief have escaped?

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.450
Manager Jie, you're mistaken.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.000
When the thief triggered the alarm in the study,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.360
I immediately sealed off all the gates.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.680
Even with divine powers, he couldn't have escaped.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.120
But you, Manager Jie,

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.800
immediately withdrew all the secret guards.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.900
The thief was clearly still inside the mansion,

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.020
yet you created such a big commotion.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.220
And the result?

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.640
Did you catch anyone?

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.160
Nonsense.

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:17.000
You.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.530
Silence, all of you!

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:27.360
Officer Li.

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:28.050
Stand up.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.080
Get up.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.260
Thank you, master.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.960
I have important news to report.

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:40.850
What are you doing here?

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:41.540
Master.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.050
I saw someone coming from the study

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.920
stealing a box and running away.

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:02.450
What did you say?

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:04.740
Was it Pang Shiyuan who stole the box?

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:07.450
Did you see clearly?

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.560
I saw clearly it was Miss Pang.

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:13.580
I never thought

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.740
I was harboring such an ungrateful wretch in my household.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.020
I also heard...

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.700
I overheard Miss Pang and that thief discussing

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.640
plans to give the box to Wei Cheng.

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:29.600
I understand now.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:30.560
That thief must have

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.840
mistaken the study for the Star-Picking Hall

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:35.100
thinking they got the Night Firefly Map.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:37.960
This Wei Cheng,

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.360
how dare he oppose me.

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.370
I will never let him get away with this.

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:44.500
Master.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.060
Wei Cheng is too arrogant.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.500
He's not only my enemy,

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.650
but now he's plotting against you too.

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.040
Wei Cheng cannot be allowed to live.

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:00.320
I have a plan.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:01.120
Speak.

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.840
Since childhood, I loved eating cherry pastries.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:08.600
My mother spoiled me

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.060
and often made them for me.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.600
But the neighbor's children

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.400
would often come and steal them.

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:15.520
So I put

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:17.600
a handful of croton powder in the cherry filling.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.060
Whoever stole them after that got diarrhea.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:20.960
The more they stole,

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.360
the worse they suffered.

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:28.560
You're comparing this box to cherry pastries,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.520
suggesting I set a poisonous trap in the box to kill Wei Cheng.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:37.840
After it's done, we can frame the Li Tang dynasty.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:42.120
This plan is truly flawless,

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.480
perfect in every way!

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:47.820
You're so brilliant, master.

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:50.090
I merely offered a simple suggestion.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:50.980
Indeed,

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:53.600
Master Chen has an excellent strategy.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.480
