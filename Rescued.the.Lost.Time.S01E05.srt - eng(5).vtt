WEBVTT

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.920
Wei.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.280
This place is so beautiful.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.760
Suli.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.400
Yezi.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.660
This will be your home from now on.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.320
No matter how hard life gets, things will eventually get better.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.000
But if you sisters are separated,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.130
it will be difficult to reunite again.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.680
Since you're staying here with me,

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.340
I can also treat your illness.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:08.480
Dr. Yu.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.120
Your great kindness.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.240
Yezi and I could never repay you in our lifetime.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.170
Come here, Yezi.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.360
I've already told you.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.820
We don't kneel in my house.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.320
Come.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.960
Sister said

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.760
if you don't let us kneel, we should give you a kiss.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.460
Go play now.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:36.840
Don't touch this.

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.640
Come here.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.120
If Officer Li sees this,

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.450
he'll scold us for sure.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:45.600
Dr. Yu.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.900
Su Li is straightforward.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.860
It's hard to keep certain things bottled up inside.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.800
That Officer Li

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.680
and the master of Chen household

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.039
are not good people.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.440
The more compassionate you are,

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.300
the more likely they'll harm you.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.010
I know my limits.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.010
You're from out of town, so you don't know.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.479
Chang'an City was

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.080
sold to the An family by them.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.480
When my father was alive, he served as Deputy Commissioner of Jingzhao Prefecture.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.740
Out of anger, he cursed them for treason,

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.120
and Prefect Wei Cheng

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.450
had him beaten to death.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:20.760
That Master Chen

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.840
and Prefect Wei are cut from the same cloth.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.370
Not a decent one among them.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.640
Take my advice.

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:28.480
Don't go to the Chen household anymore.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.079
One small mistake and you could lose your life.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:33.490
Don't worry.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.240
I've already died once.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.620
I'm not afraid.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.760
Ling.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:57.720
I failed.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.800
Take good care of your wounds.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.920
Leave the rest to me.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:03.480
No.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.380
You can't go to Zhaixing Hall.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.240
Officer Li.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.160
Miss Pang isn't feeling well?

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.220
In response to Officer Li,

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.800
The weather suddenly turned cold.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.320
Sister Pang caught a chill last night.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.520
She's suffering from a cold now.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.560
She says she has a headache.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.820
And chest discomfort.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.440
What should we do?

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.060
It's just a minor cold.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.600
Thank you for your concern, Officer Li.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.360
Miss Pang.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.720
Miss Pang.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.079
Miss Pang.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.320
Have you seen the doctor?

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.440
Do you know where Doctor Nongyu is now?

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.800
She went to the mountains to collect herbs. She's not at home.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.720
Please trouble yourself to visit another clinic, Miss Pang.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.450
Officer Li will accompany her.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.000
Qi has successfully left the city.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.640
I must thank you for your help with this.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.480
Qi is a good person.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.280
I can help you leave the city too.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.800
What?

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.840
Without having any leverage over me,

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.120
you're already making threats?

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.800
It's not a threat, but advice.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.640
The Chen household is a den of wolves.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.440
It's more dangerous than you imagine.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.520
While there's still time,

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:41.850
leave the city quickly.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.680
Thank you for your kindness, Officer Li,

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.540
but I made myself clear last time.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:46.720
You're just a frail woman,

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.480
all alone.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.080
Even with all your wits and skills,

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.200
how can you match those

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.560
powerful people who abuse their authority?

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.080
You're just a drifting weed.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.740
Why dream of reaching the sky?

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:57.920
Then what are you?

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.840
A drifting weed?

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.320
Or one of those powerful abusers of authority?

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.450
Or perhaps their underling or lapdog?

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.200
The herb shop owner is your handler.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.640
Please come in, honored guests.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.040
With so many herb shops in Chang'an,

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.800
you specifically brought me to

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.660
Jimin Herb Shop in Anye District.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.320
Just outside is Zhuque Gate Street.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.480
West connects to Yanping Gate,

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.680
south to Mingde Gate.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.760
Easy access to both east and west markets,

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:29.680
convenient for coming and going,

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.940
easy to enter and exit -

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.640
a perfect location for covert operations.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.720
Business is slow,

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.840
yet prices are higher than competitors.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.300
Clearly the owner isn't eager for business.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.880
Yet strangely,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.360
they can afford this expensive rent.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.080
They can afford this expensive rent.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.740
The night we helped Qi escape,

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.180
I recognized someone.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.720
Despite the black cloth covering their face,

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.920
I still recognized the unique herbal scent on one of them.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:58.840
You!

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.560
I was right.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.920
Unlike Officer Li, I won't be so polite.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.560
If you persist in bothering me,

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.220
I'll expose your activities.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:08.760
You!

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.720
What? Officer Li,

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.320
have I discovered your secret?

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.050
Are you planning to silence me?

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.880
This remote area

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.570
is indeed a good place to kill and hide bodies.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:21.980
Let me tell you,

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.480
don't push me too far.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.840
Officer Li seems to have forgotten

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.440
what happened last time

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:30.920
when you got this close to me.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.380
The poisonous parts of my body aren't limited to just one area.

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.780
Lord Wei invites you to tea at his residence.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.280
To hell with your tea!

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.160
Don't run!

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.410
Hurry up back there!

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.370
Chase him! Quickly!

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:04.640
Stop right there!

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:05.280
Don't run!

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:06.320
Stop!

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.040
After them!

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:08.680
Don't run!

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:11.280
Chase!

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.080
Stop!

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:14.040
Hurry!

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:19.760
Li Ling,

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.130
come with me.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:23.160
Hurry after them!

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:23.520
Yes.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:24.720
Don't let her escape!

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.200
Stop right there!

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:27.560
Don't run!

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.250
Let's go.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.200
Why are you all standing there? Search!

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.080
Nothing here.

00:07:55.159 --> 00:07:56.159
Where did they go?

00:07:57.159 --> 00:07:59.690
What are you all good for? Search everywhere!

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:08.920
How was it?

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Was rolling down the hill exciting?

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.040
How can you even ask that?

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:14.940
It hurts like hell.

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:16.880
I thought I was going to die here.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.130
Well, that's still a possibility.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.120
How about I push you out there?

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:24.520
No, no, no, no!

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.970
Mr. Li, a gentleman doesn't take advantage of others' misfortune.

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:32.520
If I were a gentleman...

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:34.360
Then what are you?

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.010
I'm a scoundrel.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.700
Speak up. I can't hear you.

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.880
I said I'm a scoundrel! Happy now?

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:46.850
That's more like it.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:49.760
What about here?

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:50.880
Did you find anything?

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:51.280
Nothing here.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.160
What about your side?

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:52.690
Nothing.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:53.940
Nothing at all.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:54.960
Mr. Wang,

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.120
we should retreat.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.040
The Chen family's guards will be here soon.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:58.840
Yes, what should we do?

00:08:58.840 --> 00:08:59.320
Bunch of useless fools.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:08:59.850
Mr. Wang,

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:00.650
let's go!

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:18.400
Master,

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:19.180
she's here.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:23.160
Come.

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:28.440
Come.

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:29.920
Let me see.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.120
Are you hurt?

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.760
Thanks to your protection,

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:41.520
I'm fine.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.890
Thanks to Officer Li for arriving in time.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:47.120
Otherwise,

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.040
my beauty would have suffered.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:51.000
Right?

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.040
In response, sir,

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.960
this is merely my duty.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.120
Nongyu,

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:02.720
Wei's people

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.360
came for you today.

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.720
What did Wang Cong say to you?

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.840
And what did you tell him?

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:14.640
What did we say?

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.000
Well...

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:19.280
Speak.

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.120
I told Wang Cong

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.400
though I'm just a humble medical woman,

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.700
I've entered the Chen household.

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.380
That makes me your person.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.280
Let alone going to Wei's mansion for tea,

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.680
even my everyday words and actions

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.760
must prioritize your interests.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:42.600
Only then can I repay your great kindness.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.720
Pleasant to hear, but not the truth.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.920
What exactly did he say to you?

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.280
I want you to tell me everything.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.480
Word for word.

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.520
Everything...

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.120
Actually...

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:04.090
Lord Wei invites you to tea at his mansion.

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:05.890
To hell with his tea!

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.360
Well said! Excellent!

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:13.560
Yuyaonu.

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:14.920
Yes?

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.650
Seize that wretched woman.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:21.160
This

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:22.480
Mr. Chen.

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:24.640
Nongyu, you're very clever.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:29.680
But you shouldn't take me for a fool.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:43.560
Wei.

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:05.160
Xie Zheng.

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:06.560
Chan Zhirui.

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:07.280
Kang Sunrui.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:07.940
Yan Zhirui.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:10.760
Ying.

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:11.560
Wang Linwang.
Ying Lu.

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:14.800
Tong Liu.
Hao Xiao.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:21.960
Li Zhang.

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:22.490
Li Zhang.

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:33.560
Liu Wang.
Jia Ningtao, Jia Yingxi, Dou Rongjing.

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:33.920
Jia Ningtao, Jia Yingxi, Dou.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.380
Jia Ningtao, Jia Yingxi, Dou Rongjing Shou.

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:44.000
Li.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:44.480
Li.

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:45.880
Assistant.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.000
Sheng Lanfengtao.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.100
Sheng Lanfengtao.

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.640
Xian Gong.
