WEBVTT

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.260
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.520
our Fulu Restaurant

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.440
not only aims to promote traditional cuisine,

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.880
but we've also incorporated Western techniques

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.680
to launch a series of new dishes

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.280
to attract more customers.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:00:59.840
I believe

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.280
before long,

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.600
our Fulu Restaurant

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.459
will become the number one restaurant in Yuncheng.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.680
Let's all work hard,

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.080
and your salaries will double when that happens.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.000
Great!

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.080
Thank you, boss! Great!

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.240
Fulu Grand Restaurant now reopened!

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.440
Welcome! Please come and taste our food!

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.200
This way, please.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.160
I've heard that Fulu Restaurant

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.360
has brought back all their classic dishes.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.620
I've traveled from afar just to try them.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.400
The only problem with Fulu Restaurant is it's too far from my home.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.060
Otherwise,

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.240
I would come here every day.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.770
Exactly.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.060
I've been craving their food.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.240
Young Master,

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.400
your luck today

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.039
isn't very good.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.440
Damn it!

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:45.360
Such rotten luck!

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.960
Master, please calm down.

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:50.570
You should have played the Two of Wan just now.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.420
Who the hell asked you to teach me how to play?

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.680
It's all because of you two jinxes.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.850
Get the hell out of here!

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:01.960
Young Master.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.520
Why are you so angry today?

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.160
Is it because of the Fulu Restaurant?

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.640
Old Mu.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.560
What about Fulu Restaurant?

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.440
You don't know yet?

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.400
Fulu Restaurant has been doing very well lately.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.320
They say it's because

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.760
the Elder Young Master and his wife know how to run a business.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.320
The restaurant is gradually returning to its former glory.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.280
Shut up.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.960
Never mention the young mistress in front of me again.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.840
Sir.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.720
We need to increase our monthly opium supply.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.280
I've already made arrangements.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.360
All the brothels in the city

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.840
must use my product.

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.160
I want to see

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.240
how they can compete with me

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.579
in revenue with just a small restaurant.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.240
I want everyone to know.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.960
I am the pillar of the Liu family.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:00.880
Second Young Master,

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:01.760
it's like this.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.700
Our current volume is already large enough.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.320
If we increase it further,

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.720
it's not very realistic.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:08.320
Besides,

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.600
both the underworld and authorities are watching us now.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.800
If you cut off someone else's livelihood,

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.600
they'll come after us with everything they've got.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.120
Since when did you become such a coward?

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.400
Hey, don't worry.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.240
In Yuncheng, we have Commander Xu backing us up.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.680
Who would dare mess with us in Yuncheng?

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.360
Second Young Master,

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.760
are you perhaps angry with the First Young Mistress

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.320
and trying to drag us into taking risks?

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.120
Didn't I say

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.600
never to mention the First Young Mistress again?

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.400
Come on, we're all friends here.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.480
What are you doing?

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.600
Old Mu, you...

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.400
Apologize!

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.400
Oh, Second Young Master,

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.760
it was my fault just now.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:48.960
My Second Young Master,

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.820
Old Mu is our long-time customer.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.680
How can we work together if you act like this?

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.320
Right?

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.960
With my current status in Yuncheng as Liu Sinan,

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.780
what does it matter if I offend one customer?

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:02.800
Besides,

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.820
everyone is fighting to do business with me now.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.880
Get out!

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.240
Hey, hey, Old Mu!

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.800
I'm telling you... oh my!

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.120
Hey, Old Mu!

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:18.320
Really...

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:30.320
Mr. Mu.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.960
Mr. Mu, Mr. Mu.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.320
The young master is impetuous.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.780
Don't take it personally.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.560
He's completely full of himself now.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.120
He's not the same person I used to do business with.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.960
Sigh.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.120
One day

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.050
he will destroy the Liu family.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:48.680
Goodbye.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.040
Sigh.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.960
Didn't I tell you to get lost?

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.200
Why are you back?

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.290
Who made the young master angry again?

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.440
You did.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.120
Just a casino owner.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.440
What are you doing here?

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.280
This is no place for women.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.600
I'm here for my fiancÃ©.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.160
Sinan.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.200
You're out all night,

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.040
staying in places like this.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.280
Do you even care about me anymore?

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.720
It's business networking.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.640
What would a woman know about it?

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.280
Sinan.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.380
I heard your conversation with Mr. Sun just now.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.280
Didn't my father tell you

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.720
to be kind to others,

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.480
not to push things too far?

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.280
That's how business lasts.

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.159
Besides,

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.960
you're always so reckless.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.120
After we're married,

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.720
how can my father feel comfortable entrusting me to you?

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.850
Commander Xu should just focus on his military affairs.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.880
Business matters

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.840
are not his concern.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.280
Liu Sinan.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.560
Do you know who you're talking to?

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.280
Without my father,

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.160
your shady businesses wouldn't be this successful.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.290
They would've been shut down long ago.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.040
Commander Xu just expanded his army.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.280
And built a new mansion.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.160
Wasn't that all funded by me?

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.760
Who really needs whom?

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.610
That's not certain yet.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:37.840
Liu Sinan, you...

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.320
The restaurant is officially launching delivery service today.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.520
Free delivery

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.200
within 3 kilometers.

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.120
Regular customers who deposit 2 silver dollars

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.880
can enjoy 20% off on all dishes.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.200
Goodbye, ma'am.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.680
The restaurant is no longer exclusive to officials and nobles.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.520
We've also introduced affordable dishes

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.980
and welcome everyone in town to dine with us.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.040
Please don't rush, you two.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:21.880
Please wait over there for a moment.

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.010
I'll be right there.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.850
Bring a pot of water to the table in the middle.

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:35.960
Come again, gentlemen.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:45.120
Mother.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.520
Your spirits in heaven must be

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.480
very happy seeing all this.

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.040
Business is good.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.120
It seems

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.680
Fulu Restaurant is truly back on track again.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.840
The master in heaven

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.160
would be greatly comforted.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.360
Your father, Jiang Huai,

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:18.300
would surely be happy for you too.

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:19.880
Thank you.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.360
If you hadn't helped us find the recipe,

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.600
the restaurant wouldn't be doing so well.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.400
It's what I should do.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.040
My daughter,

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:32.600
you've decided

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.559
to be with the eldest young master sincerely.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.720
Good.

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:43.880
The eldest young master's madness was fake,

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.840
and you two get along well.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.960
My worried heart

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.600
can finally be at ease.

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.000
This second young master,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.880
after becoming the head of the family,

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.940
has indeed become quite outrageous.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.480
It seems that position

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.960
really can change a person.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:03.600
My daughter,

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.500
no matter what path you choose in the future,

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.040
I will support you.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.100
Thank you, Father.

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:19.040
What are you good for?

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:20.960
You can't even brew a pot of tea properly.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.600
Are you trying to scald me to death?

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.060
Get out!

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:24.400
Get out!

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:32.840
Hey.

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:36.040
If you're trying to persuade me

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:37.960
not to increase the order quantity,

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.360
I advise you not to say it.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.210
What did you say?

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:43.840
Fulu Restaurant.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.260
I certainly know their business is booming now.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.640
Do you have any way

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.770
to cause them some trouble?

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.410
Stop eating, everyone.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:10.840
Who are you people

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.300
coming to my territory causing trouble?

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.720
Isn't this the eldest young master of the Liu family?

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:17.640
No wonder.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.160
How can food made by a lunatic be edible?

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.420
What are you doing?

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.600
If you keep causing trouble, we'll report you to the authorities.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.800
Report to the authorities?

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.040
We haven't reported anything yet.

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.280
You want to report us?

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:28.210
What do you mean?

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.040
Bring it in.

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:37.080
Today at noon,

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.400
my uncle had a meal at your Fulu Restaurant,

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:42.360
and he ate something bad there,

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.360
now he's bedridden.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:45.480
What do you think

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:46.850
we should do about this?

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.400
It hurts so much!

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:49.720
I'm dying!

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.400
So what do you want?

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.460
Here's what I want:

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.240
pay my uncle 500 silver dollars

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.160
and publish an apology in the newspaper.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.290
This is ridiculous.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.800
I think you're just trying to extort us.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.240
Before we've investigated this matter thoroughly,

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.840
on what grounds can you claim

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.960
that he got sick from eating at our restaurant?

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:15.490
Exactly.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.040
Words alone are no proof.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:17.800
Besides,

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.960
we've never even seen your uncle.

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:22.720
The biggest restaurant in town, Fulu Restaurant,

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.440
using your size to bully customers,

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.760
making people sick and refusing to admit it.

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:27.600
In the future,

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.500
who would dare eat here again?

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:31.840
What proof do you have

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.400
that he got sick from eating at our restaurant?

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.720
You won't be satisfied until you see the Yellow River!

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.720
If we hadn't consulted a doctor,

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.400
would we be here again?

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:42.640
Go get Dr. Li.

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.600
This is Dr. Li from Li's Clinic in the south of town.

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.040
He just examined the old master.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:58.160
Dr. Li.

00:11:58.520 --> 00:11:59.600
Please tell us,

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:02.040
what's wrong with my father?

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.960
I just examined the old master.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.040
The old master

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:11.200
is definitely suffering from food poisoning.

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:18.280
Sir,

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.040
what did you eat?

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:23.700
It's that dish.

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.260
Dr. Li, please take a look.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:33.480
Dr. Li.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.040
Can you tell me

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:36.860
what's wrong with my dish?

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.400
Dr. Li.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.720
Feel free to speak.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.600
My brothers and I

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.680
will definitely support you

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.480
and your family.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:10.000
Yu.
