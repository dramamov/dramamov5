Ms. Gu.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.418
If GL could work with Xinyi,

00:01:06.419 --> 00:01:09.279
it would set a new standard
for the jewelry industry.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.200
We'd surely be
the industry's number one.

00:01:12.699 --> 00:01:14.919
Mr. Lin, fame draws trouble.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.999
Isn't it better to let all succeed?

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.459
Xuan, fetch my wine from the car.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.698
Tonight, I'll have a good drink
with the two bosses.

00:01:21.699 --> 00:01:23.400
Good idea.

00:01:25.059 --> 00:01:25.739
Really?

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:26.919
Go.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.919
(Today's dinner guests
are ill-intentioned. Backup.)

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:40.200
Something came up. I have to go.

00:01:40.699 --> 00:01:41.840
Where to?

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:49.559
And you said you didn't like her.

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:54.138
Isn't GL backed by Lu Jianhua?

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:56.338
If you want a man,

00:01:56.339 --> 00:01:58.218
you could just choose me.

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:59.739
I can do that.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.919
My overseas assets
are no less than Lu Jianhua's.

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:08.058
A woman's destiny

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:11.799
is to find a man in the end.

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:16.679
Mr. Lin.

00:02:18.779 --> 00:02:19.959
Mr. Lin.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.880
A toast to you.

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:24.359
You speak so pleasantly.

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:26.218
That's more like it.

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:27.639
Good.

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:42.899
You're really profiting
from today's medical fee.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.498
You little vixen.

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:46.200
What nonsense is this?

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:49.259
- Mr. Lin.
- Mr. Lin.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.979
Now we're both fighting.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.799
Your medical fee's gone again.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.498
Mr. Lin.

00:02:54.499 --> 00:02:55.019
Gu Liusu.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.618
Call the police!

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:58.818
- Calm down.
- Call the police!

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:00.079
- Lin Xiang!
- Call the police!

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.280
Mr. Lin.

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:04.760
Call the police!

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:06.600
Gu Liusu.

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:08.720
You're bleeding?

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.200
Call the police.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.880
Alright, I'll go now.

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.338
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:16.440
Why are you here?

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:17.699
Does it hurt?

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.880
Don't look so glum. It's just wine.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:23.658
I already know

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:25.119
(Police)
what happened.

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:28.119
This does count as excessive defense.

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:30.699
The other party
will get a medical appraisal.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.459
He insists on legal action.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.359
You weren't even invited to this dinner,

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:36.880
yet you showed up and attacked someone.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.019
You think you're innocent?

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.299
Even if she's your girlfriend,
it's no excuse. Understand?

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.239
I...

00:03:42.779 --> 00:03:44.019
She's not my girlfriend.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.179
Not your girlfriend?

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.320
What are you doing then?
Acting righteous?

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.359
I'm her boss.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.739
I get how you feel,

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.419
but hitting people is wrong.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.139
Understand?

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.919
That brat dares to hit me!

00:03:58.059 --> 00:03:58.979
You old pervert!

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.579
You lecher,
how dare you act so righteous?

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:01.498
Wait and see!

00:04:01.499 --> 00:04:02.139
Brat!

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.139
You'll get a criminal record,
you know that?

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.000
You might as well go and talk it out.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.459
Apologize or offer compensation
if needed.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:08.960
He harassed her.
Why should we apologize?

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:09.919
I know.

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:11.139
Officer.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.179
I'll go apologize.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.938
Apologize?

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:14.600
Why should we apologize?

00:04:14.779 --> 00:04:17.039
Lu Xingchen, let go.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.719
Let go!

00:04:31.179 --> 00:04:32.059
Sir.

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.019
Calm down.

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.778
Alright, Sir.

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:35.639
Don't be mad.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.059
Officer.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.738
May I speak privately with Mr. Lin?

00:04:39.739 --> 00:04:40.538
You may.

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:41.560
Thank you.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.360
Watch your attitude.

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:50.599
Mr. Lin.

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:52.800
I'm sorry for what happened.

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.399
I apologize to you.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.560
As long as you agree to one condition,

00:04:58.779 --> 00:05:00.279
I can settle this with you.

00:05:00.739 --> 00:05:04.680
You're negotiating with me?

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.760
Do you think you have the right
to bargain with me?

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:16.039
Mr. Jing's half of the jewelry
went to Xinyi, right?

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:23.000
And about Xinyi's slander
against GL earlier,

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.279
I can give you the original contract.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.719
I wonder if you're satisfied
with this gift.

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:34.619
What's the condition?

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.839
Sign a letter of forgiveness
for Lu Xingchen.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.680
I can sign it,

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.920
but I can't swallow this anger.

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.000
Ms. Gu, slap yourself three times,

00:05:46.739 --> 00:05:49.039
then I can forgive him.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.599
Isn't it just to cheer Mr. Lin up?

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:02.519
Easy.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.240
Gu Liusu, what are you doing?

00:06:12.739 --> 00:06:14.418
Lin Xiang, are you looking for trouble?

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:15.338
What are you doing?

00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:17.778
What are you doing? Mind your attitude!

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:20.839
Lu Xingchen, this is a police station.

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.658
Calm down.

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:23.338
Officer.

00:06:23.339 --> 00:06:26.479
He keeps giving you trouble.
How can I stay calm?

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:30.159
Mr. Lu.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.059
Mr. Lu.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.680
What brings you here?

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.978
Be careful with your behavior in public.

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:36.658
Don't cause more trouble.

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:37.858
Officer.

00:06:37.859 --> 00:06:39.379
Sorry for the trouble.

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:40.680
It's the kid's fault.

00:06:41.539 --> 00:06:42.858
Come with me.

00:06:42.859 --> 00:06:44.000
Sign here.

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:47.880
Mr. Lu, I'll go now.

00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:55.120
Get in the car.

00:07:12.419 --> 00:07:14.039
You said you'd handle Lin Xiang

00:07:14.779 --> 00:07:16.120
and look after Gu Liusu.

00:07:16.179 --> 00:07:17.560
Is this how you do it?

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.139
Should I beat someone
and end up in the police station,

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:22.560
then have your father
clean up your mess?

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:27.240
Get in the car.

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.320
Still not getting in?

00:07:34.299 --> 00:07:36.000
I'm taking Gu Liusu home.

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:49.920
I told you to watch my son.

00:07:50.219 --> 00:07:51.719
Is this how you do it?

00:07:52.979 --> 00:07:54.079
I'm sorry.

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:38.160
How about a walk?

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:39.999
Okay.

00:08:52.299 --> 00:08:54.640
I was impulsive today.
I didn't expect you'd come.

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:56.359
I was worried about you.

00:08:56.939 --> 00:08:59.680
I just wanted to use the contract
to vent my anger,

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.040
but dragged you into it.

00:09:03.419 --> 00:09:05.040
It's nothing like that.

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:11.479
Gu Liusu.

00:09:14.579 --> 00:09:17.719
Next time, don't drink so much.

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:19.619
They won't respect you more

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:20.800
just because you drink more.

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.239
You don't need to prove
your worth to anyone.

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:29.959
