WEBVTT

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.080
Let's go.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.240
Where to?

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:03.600
I'm telling you to leave.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.960
You don't understand me?

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.960
Haven't had enough prison food yet?

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.280
Oh right.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.060
You don't know yet, do you?

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:11.960
Your wife has confessed.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.960
All that opium belongs to her.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.920
I'm afraid you won't see her again.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.130
What did you say?

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.130
What do you mean?

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.040
What are you talking about?

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.280
Let go of me!

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.760
What did you do to Qianyiyu?

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.079
What have you done to her?

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:27.440
Let me go! All of you!

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.400
Qianyiyu!

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.640
Why?

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.600
Tell me!

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.520
Explain yourselves clearly!

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.000
Why did Qianyiyu confess?

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.880
Come out!

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:40.320
Let me in!

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.040
Release Qianyiyu now!

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:43.079
Free Qianyiyu!

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.240
Let her go!

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.120
Open the door!

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.640
Open up! Open up!

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.520
Let me in.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.900
I need to see the chief.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.040
I confess.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.040
I'll confess.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.960
Just release Qian Yiyu,

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.490
and I'll admit to anything.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.040
If you've got the guts, just shoot me.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.960
Just let her go.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.400
Stop shouting.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.320
It's useless.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.480
The evidence is conclusive. The case can't be overturned.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.740
You should go home now.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.160
The main culprit will be executed in 3 days.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.760
Nothing you say now matters.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:10.960
What did you say?

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.090
That's impossible.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.960
Why?

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.880
She's innocent.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:17.600
She's been wronged.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.520
Someone is framing us.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.400
You can't just

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.800
make a final judgment like this.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.520
If you don't leave now...

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.850
I'll blow your head off.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.040
Silin.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.120
Qian Yiyu will be executed in three days.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.079
That's quite a predicament.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.960
You called me here

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.160
just to mock me?

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.800
Don't be so agitated, young master.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.400
Qian Yiyu would rather sacrifice himself to protect you.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.760
That's truly enviable.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.520
I have a solution.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.290
Help you rescue that woman.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.050
Do you really have a way to help me rescue Yiyu?

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.000
I can step in and help you solve this matter.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.120
But, Young Master Liu,

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.560
you must agree to one condition.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.240
What condition?

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.880
They're coming.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.000
What are you doing?

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.720
If we don't save her now,

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:07.720
it'll be too late.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.530
I'll definitely fulfill what I promised you.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.920
Honey chestnut cake.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.740
I used to love the pastries your father made.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.100
So I tried to make them based on my memory.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.850
I don't know if they taste good.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.400
Hot!

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Silin.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.000
Brother Silin,

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.160
please don't go!

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.320
Don't you care what others think of you?

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.120
I don't care.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.380
If they want to make me out to be a murderous monster,

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:33.320
a madman,

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.650
then I'll play along with their game till the end.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.840
And now I have you.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.290
As long as you keep believing in me,

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.540
understanding me,

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.810
I'm not afraid of anything.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:51.960
Liu Silin.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.360
Why

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.090
are you doing this to me?

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.740
What are you doing?

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.260
Has the young master forgotten what he promised me?

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:05.120
I can help you resolve this matter.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.520
But Master Liu,

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.920
you must agree to one condition.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:15.520
What condition?

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.240
I request that the young master

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.200
continue to honor our engagement.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.250
It's coming undone.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.080
You...

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.770
What are you going to do?

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:47.600
Qian Yiyu,

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:48.800
you may leave now.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.000
Why?

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.440
Just leave when I tell you to.

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.770
Stop talking nonsense.

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:55.400
Go.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.240
If you don't make me feel better,

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.560
I might get angry

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.560
and have Director Wang arrest Qian Yiyu again.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.120
These wounds,

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.410
you got them because of Qian Yiyu, didn't you?

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.080
What's so good about her?

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.720
She only brings you pain.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.280
You do so much for her.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.320
Is it worth it?

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.799
Whether it's worth it or not is my business.

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:40.260
I don't need your concern.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.280
Why are you always so cold to me?

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.180
Are you much gentler with that Qian Yiyu?

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:49.160
At that party,

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:52.080
you deliberately approached me to make her jealous.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.280
You even claimed I gave you some sachet.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.810
You never gave me anything.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.260
Why did you have to do that?

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.380
I deliberately made her misunderstand.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.340
Because someone of her status doesn't deserve you.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.000
I wanted her to know

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.320
that if she weren't around,

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.280
I would be the one marrying you.

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:13.860
You're talking nonsense.

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:16.360
You were the one who broke off our engagement.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.620
How dare you claim you wanted to marry me?

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.820
That's because you were acting crazy for no reason.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.040
With my status as Xu Shuyun in Yun City,

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.320
how could I possibly marry someone so insignificant?

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.720
Then why did you come looking for me today?

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.360
You're hurting me.

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.240
I've done so much for you.

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:42.360
Because I care about you.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.520
How could you treat me like this?

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:52.280
As long as you treat me well,

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:54.360
I promise

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.160
Qian Yiyu will be safe.

00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:59.720
Is Yiyu really safe now?

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.820
How did you manage to save her?

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.200
I have my ways.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.400
Miss Xu, what an honor to have you here.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.930
What brings you here today?

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.280
I came today

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.940
to ask you, Director Wang,

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:18.520
to release Qian Yiyu.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:20.360
Miss Xu.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.960
Do you think our police station is a place

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:26.400
where you can just demand someone's release?

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:27.930
You're being far too naive.

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.610
Perhaps Miss Xu, being privileged, tends to forget things.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.200
I'm afraid you've forgotten

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.600
that Yuncheng now

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.920
is General Wu's territory.

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:42.450
Do you think we're still in the days when Commander Xu had all the power?

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.520
For others,

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.130
things might have changed.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.700
But Director Wang, don't forget,

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:51.450
you were one of my father's old subordinates.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.320
What you've done in the past,

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.760
no one knows better than my father.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.960
As long as you still want to keep your position in Yuncheng.

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.020
Just release the person obediently.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.400
Otherwise,

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.600
tomorrow's headline

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.020
will be about you, Director Wang,

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.960
and your corruption.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.160
You...

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:12.520
Tell me,

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:16.760
what will General Wu do when that happens?

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.640
You little girl!

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.280
I've watched you grow up,

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.960
and now you think you're so tough,

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.290
daring to blackmail me?

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.840
Fine. You win.

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:30.760
What do you want me to do?

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:31.720
What to do?

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.640
I think you know better than I do, Director.

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.280
How about that, Silin?

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.400
Shouldn't you

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.360
thank me properly now?

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.400
Silin.

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.960
You've always been the one I love.

00:11:58.520 --> 00:11:59.840
If you hadn't pretended to be crazy,

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.520
my father would never have agreed to our marriage.

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.450
We would already be a family by now.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.720
And what about that Qian Yiyu?

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:07.960
Wait.

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.530
Something's wrong with this perfume.

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:18.760
Silin!
