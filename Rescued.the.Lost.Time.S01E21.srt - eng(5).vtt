WEBVTT

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.920
Wei.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.760
This is a military order!

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.680
Do it now!

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.160
General.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.600
General, if your spirit is watching from heaven,

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.200
please lend me your strength

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.380
to eliminate the traitors

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.740
and restore the Tang Dynasty.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.479
I need to go to Jimin Pharmacy

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.450
to let Zhuang Yao know I'm safe.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.840
Wait for me to return.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.300
Master.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.200
The Tang army has already captured

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.520
many strategic locations outside Chang'an.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.800
They're about to break through.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:05.960
Jieniu and the other two

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.000
haven't returned yet.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.199
Could something have happened to them?

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.120
Why panic?

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.640
We've weathered all kinds of storms.

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:22.200
Everything is under my control.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.130
What did you say?

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.610
Nongyu is Feng Jianye's daughter.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.579
I must tell her.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.690
I must tell her everything.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.520
Tell her what?

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:39.400
Tell her

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.160
that you personally delivered her father's head

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.720
to Chen Jingbian?

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.140
Let me tell you.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.400
If she learns the truth,

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.360
no matter how you explain it,

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.240
it will sound like mere excuses.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.930
All those passionate vows between you two

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.400
will instantly crumble.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.290
She'll only see you as enemies.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.130
She'll hate you to the bone.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.300
This is a critical moment.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.690
We must remain loyal to our duties.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.840
If at this moment,

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.380
because of Nongyu,

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.680
complications arise

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.680
and cause trouble,

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.210
everything we've done before will be wasted.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.400
When that happens,

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.080
how will you explain to His Majesty?

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.210
How will you face our fallen brothers?

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.079
Can you face

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:20.940
General Feng who entrusted you with his dying wish?

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.340
I'll find a suitable time to tell her.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.610
I'm telling you,

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.620
these words...

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:28.240
You...

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.460
You must keep them buried in your gut.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.579
The most crucial thing now

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.560
is to prevent Nongyu from returning to Chen's mansion.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.840
She'll definitely ask Chen Jingbian about that sword.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.079
Don't worry about that.

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:40.560
I've already thought it through.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.200
Otherwise I wouldn't have used you as an excuse

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:42.880
to leave.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.370
I can't let her be in danger.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.970
What are you going to do?

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.180
I'll go back alone.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.320
First, I'll finish the butchering task

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.780
and pacify Chen Jingbian.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.060
As for the rest,

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.420
I'll have to play it by ear.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.600
Good.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.170
Now the main Tang forces

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.090
have already assembled outside the city.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.320
The Night Firefly Map

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.100
must be obtained as soon as possible.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:09.290
Alright.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.399
Li Congshi, you're finally back.

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:21.329
Are you alright?

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.220
Li Congshi.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.240
Where is Master Chen?

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.170
I need to see him.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.960
Why did you come back alone?

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:29.890
Where's Nongyu?

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:31.480
Don't ask.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:32.800
Where is Master Chen?

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.080
The master is meeting with guests.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.880
Let me ask you.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.100
What about Jieniu?

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.680
Jieniu?

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.780
Master sent Jieniu to follow you.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.020
Didn't you see him?

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.000
Master sent Jieniu to follow us?

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:45.440
I was following Nongyu and the undercover agent.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.840
Jieniu was following me.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.220
This shows distrust in me.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:50.610
Master Chen!

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.970
I need to see you!

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.560
I told you the master is with guests.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.960
Master Chen!

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:54.480
Did you hear me?

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.210
Master Chen!

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.930
Who's making all that noise out there?

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.970
Master Chen.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:01.440
I heard that

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.640
you sent Jieniu to follow me.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.920
You're doubting my loyalty, aren't you?

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.040
How could that be?

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:08.560
Back then,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.130
when you brought me Feng Jianye's head

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.640
along with his precious sword,

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.400
I knew you would always be loyal to me.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.520
Young Master Su,

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.320
did you hear that?

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.920
That's the origin of the precious sword Yulinxun.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.920
Just now,

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.980
you were questioning its authenticity.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.159
Now you should believe it, right?

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:38.880
I see now.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.920
Li Ling.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:42.250
Yes, sir.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.500
Pay your respects to Young Master Su,

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.690
the leader of the Eighteen Bandits of Guantian Society.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.040
Greetings, Master Su.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.970
No need for that.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.600
Actually, we just met outside the city.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.240
We almost came to blows.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.480
He mistook me for Tang soldiers.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.340
Fortunately, I reacted quickly.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.020
Otherwise,

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.600
I wouldn't be meeting Master Chen today.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.860
Who would have thought

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.680
we're actually on the same side.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:15.740
Indeed.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.530
I was pursuing Nongyu and that undercover agent.

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.040
But unexpectedly encountered Tang soldiers on the way.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.770
They were about to be captured.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.880
I fought desperately to save them.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.140
But I was outnumbered.

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.440
I barely managed to fight my way out.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.290
Then I ran into Young Master Su.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:33.880
At that time, I thought

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.940
they were Tang soldiers in disguise.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.600
So I made a move against them.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:40.570
How dare you!

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.940
Do you know who Young Master Su is?

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.460
How dare you be so bold!

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.000
Apologize now!

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.440
Enough, enough.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.080
What can I say? I, Su Changming, am magnanimous as the sea

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.210
and tolerant of all.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:55.720
I'll let it go.

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.290
Thank you, Young Master Su.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:02.980
Li Ling,

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.530
where is Nongyu?

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.120
The situation was critical.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.480
I couldn't save her in time.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.010
She might have been captured by the Tang army.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:14.880
Captured by the Tang army?

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:15.940
Alright, alright.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.640
They're all useless.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.860
I'll find another way to deal with Nongyu's situation.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:23.440
Li Ling,

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:25.640
you may leave now.

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:27.520
Yes, Master Chen.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.490
Young Master Su,

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.250
please come with me.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.360
You want me to rescue that woman from the Tang army.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.400
This woman is highly skilled in medicine.

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.960
If I lose her,

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.960
when my migraines strike,

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.720
it could be fatal.

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:15.940
I can only blame

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.000
that my men are all useless.

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.600
Unlike your Guantian Society,

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.850
which is brave and invincible.

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.000
Sir Chen,

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.540
you're trying to test me, aren't you?

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.120
Not at all.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.400
I'm simply asking for your help.

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:37.460
You're asking for quite a lot.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.120
You want me to fight the Tang army and defend Chang'an,

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.919
and now you want me to rescue a woman too.

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:45.320
No matter how I look at it, it's not worth it.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.160
Since we're working together,

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:52.000
how could I let you do all the work alone?

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:54.450
You have the men,

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.240
I have the map.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.320
If I bring her back,

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.720
you can take the Night Firefly Map

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.540
and enjoy it as you please.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:06.640
Good,

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:07.680
it's a deal.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:30.200
Li Ling.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.360
I just saved your life.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.840
How are you going to thank me?

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:37.840
That old bastard approached you

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.930
because he wants to use you as a pawn

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.560
to defend Chang'an, right?

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:42.080
Smart.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.360
That old eunuch's infighting killed Wei Cheng.

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.720
Now that disaster is coming,

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.520
he wants my men as cannon fodder.

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:49.600
He's treating

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.780
the eighteen bandit groups of Guantian Society

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:53.920
like beggars.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.890
Did you say that to his face?

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:56.480
No.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.480
I agreed to his terms.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.480
The exchange is for the Night Firefly Map.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.480
Thanks to you,

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.340
we can't count on Nongyu anymore.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:10.520
According to her,

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:12.360
I need to rely on my own abilities.

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.320
But guess what?

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:17.020
To test my abilities, that old eunuch

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.330
actually made another demand:

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:20.720
to bring Nongyu back.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.480
Isn't that ridiculous?

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.200
So what do you plan to do?

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:28.160
I've said before,

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.330
both the woman and the sword

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:31.520
will be mine.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.170
But you wouldn't believe me

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.360
and bet your life against me.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.080
Now I want to see

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.010
how you're going to win.

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.240
You never exposed me.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:45.720
Actually,

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.080
you were just waiting

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.400
to see what terms I might offer, right?

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.530
Whatever the terms,

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.560
both the woman and the sword will be mine.

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:56.490
I could reveal your true identity to that old eunuch.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:57.600
Just imagine,

00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.210
would he flay you alive?

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.800
I could also tell Nongyu

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.650
about how you betrayed your master for glory.

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.200
Guess how she would react?

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.700
No matter the outcome of this bet,

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:14.600
you're bound to lose.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.040
If I were you,

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.140
I would return both Nongyu

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:20.360
and the sword.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.330
Perhaps if I'm pleased,

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.660
I'll let you take a look at the map,

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:28.040
fulfilling your final wish before you die.

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:29.970
If you've made up your mind,

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.600
come to Zuixiang Tower where there are flowers and wine

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.320
and find me.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:12.840
Yiyu.

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:19.120

Xie Zheng.

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:19.920
Xie Zheng.

Kang Sunrui.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:22.720
Yan Zhirui.

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:25.160
Ying.

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:25.720
Yinglu.

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:26.000
Wang Linwang.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:26.800
Wang Linwang.
Yinglu.

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:30.160
Hao Xiao.
Tong Liu.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:36.880
Li Zhang.

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:48.440
Jia Ningao Jia.

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:49.160
Liu Wang.
Jia Ningtao Jia Yingxi.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:49.400
Jia Ningtao Jia Yingxi Dourong.

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:52.000
Jia Ningtao Jia Yingxi Dourong Jingshou Peng.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:12:59.520
Li.

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:01.160
Li.
Assistant Li.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:01.840
Li.

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.680
Sheng Lanfeng Tao.

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:06.600
Limited.

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:08.720
Public Limited.
