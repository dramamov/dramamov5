00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.920
Hey!

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.120
Master!

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.000
Master!

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.930
What are you yelling about?

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.880
Is the King of Hell coming for you?

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.160
That escaped thief...

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.800
Did you catch him?

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:04.840
No, I didn't.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.520
But I caught a big fish.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.320
You little brat!

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.580
What's wrong with you?

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.760
You didn't catch the thief.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.360
Instead, two lives were lost under your watch.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.360
And you still had time to catch fish?

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.060
Where's this fish you caught?

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:24.400
No, no.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.400
Master, look.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.280
That night I saw clearly.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.780
These are the clothes the thief was wearing.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.080
What is this thing?

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.680
Sir,

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.440
please take a closer look.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.520
Don't you find this object familiar?

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:58.440
So it was him.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.520
No wonder we couldn't catch them.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.440
I see now.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.040
Dr. Nongyu, thank you for your hard work preparing the medicine,

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.500
but you don't need to deliver it personally.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.660
There's still one final step.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.050
May I borrow your knife?

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.620
What are you doing?

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.920
The last person who touched this knife

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.160
died a terrible death.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.440
Are you sure about this?

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.079
If you keep struggling like this

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:36.520
and spill Master Chen's medicine,

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.050
neither of us will survive.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.340
Hold it steady.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.040
The final step

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.010
is to add my blood as a catalyst.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:55.500
Step aside.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.040
I need to see Chen Jingbian.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.760
Manager Wang, you cannot enter.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.420
Move aside.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.960
If this matter is delayed,

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.080
you'll face consequences you can't handle.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.940
You really cannot enter. Please don't put us in a difficult position.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.130
Let him through.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.400
Yes.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.840
May I ask what brings you here, Magistrate Wei?

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.890
Sir, Nongyu is outside with medicine.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.160
My daughter Nongyu specially requests Mr. Chen to try her medicine.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.400
Li Ling.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.970
I'm telling you, you're doomed this time.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:40.280
Mr. Chen.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.400
Mr. Chen.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.600
You've misjudged people and nurtured a tiger that will bring disaster.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.520
Today, I

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.680
have come specifically to solve your problems.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.480
If you put it that way,

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.640
the Magistrate is overthinking.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.080
Everyone in my household

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.160
is brave and capable.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.160
I wonder which 'tiger'

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.560
the Magistrate is referring to?

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.320
That's him.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:19.810
Magistrate Wei.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.760
You've never liked me.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.160
Today you trespassed into the Chen residence.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.880
If you continue with inappropriate remarks,

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.760
it would be embarrassing if word got out.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:29.400
Li Ling.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.050
Stop acting innocent when you're doomed.

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:34.760
Our clerk Li is actually an undercover agent.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.690
He's working with the map thieves.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.450
All that talk about solving problems,

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.440
when you were actually targeting my trusted aide.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.010
Magistrate Wei,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.840
since this show has begun,

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.560
please make your accusations clear.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.920
Show this to Lord Chen.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.040
Lord Chen,

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.690
these clothes belong to the map thief.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.200
This bone whistle...

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.200
Lord Chen must recognize it, right?

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.400
The bloodstained clothes and the whistle were found together.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.730
Li Ling must have met the agent that night.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.960
If they claim not to know each other,

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.840
even ghosts wouldn't believe it.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.720
He's been fooling all of us.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:17.800
Li Ling,

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.570
you never part with your bone whistle.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.930
How do you explain this?

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.160
Mr. Chen.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.520
This bone whistle isn't mine.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.040
Then show us yours.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.800
Everyone in Chang'an knows

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.920
you're the one who plays this thing.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:36.820
Where's yours?

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.280
Show it to us.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.760
Let us see it.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.180
What are you doing?

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.530
Stop this improper physical contact.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.580
I'll give it to you.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.120
Is this the thing?

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.730
Thank you for lending me the knife.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.200
Now I'm returning it to its rightful owner.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.000
I was wondering where it went.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.880
So it was here.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.960
The string broke yesterday.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.960
I tied it to the knife without thinking.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.020
And then completely forgot about it.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.720
This must be fake.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:25.240
You!

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.640
I didn't mean to.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.680
I just took it to have a look.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.410
I didn't know it was so fragile.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.840
Please forgive me, sir.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.880
What a show!

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:45.720
Magistrate Wei,

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:47.920
I had no idea

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.800
you possessed such skills.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.000
If you visit my residence again,

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.600
I will welcome you with open arms.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.120
As it happens,

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.040
a few days ago,

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.280
someone sent me

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.400
a jar of excellent osmanthus wine.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.960
Come to my residence another day,

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.420
and we shall drink together. What do you say?

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:10.280
Alright.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:14.840
You fool!

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:15.720
Idiot!

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:16.810
What a disgrace!

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.720
Li Ling must be playing us for fools.

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.520
What does it have to do with me?

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:26.760
He's making a fool of you, not me.

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:27.320
Yes, yes.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.360
You haven't figured out a damn thing,

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.220
and let Chen Jingbian laugh at us.

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.159
That beggar's worthless junk,

00:07:33.159 --> 00:07:34.890
and you treat it like treasure.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.200
Master, spare some change.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:39.130
Get lost!

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.360
You little beggar!

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.640
You've dirtied my clothes.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:42.500
Get out of here!

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.620
Hey! Stop right there.

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:45.680
Bad luck.

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:48.560
Wait a moment.

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:49.920
Come here.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:58.720
Let me ask you.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.600
Where did you get these clothes?

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:03.360
Speak up!

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:04.920
I'll kill you if you don't talk.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.920
I found them in an abandoned house.

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.280
What about this whistle?

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.760
Found it there too.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:15.680
Sir.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.880
A child's testimony isn't reliable.

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:19.540
What are you afraid of?

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.370
As long as Li Ling can't produce the bone whistle,

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:23.640
we can nail him.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:24.440
Yes.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.180
Take it off.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:28.130
Come.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:32.120
Go.

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:38.880
Hold on, Li Ling.

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.159
Who was that woman today?

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.080
She looks like a favored servant

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.000
yet dares to speak up.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:44.360
Sir,

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:45.360
I've checked.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:46.940
She's a doctor.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:50.040
I heard she cured Chen Jingbian's migraines

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.700
and is currently in favor.

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:56.300
To think she could cure such a stubborn illness.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.320
I thought that old eunuch wouldn't live much longer.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.240
Lucky for him.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.040
Investigate this female doctor.

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.500
Find out who she really is.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.570
Put some effort into it.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:08.820
Rest assured, sir.

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.450
You stole the bone whistle.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.010
Mr. Li, mind your behavior.

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:20.700
You're playing me.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.000
If you continue like this, I'll call for help.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.080
Let's see what's faster, your mouth or my knife.

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.120
Why are you setting me up?

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:27.850
You shouldn't have stopped me.

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:29.760
What exactly are you trying to do?

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.890
Whatever I do is none of your business.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.120
For Qi's sake,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.730
don't force me to use violence.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:01.440
How are

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:03.450
you feeling?

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.840
This is Danfei poison from the Western Regions.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.640
Are you feeling dizzy

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.160
and weak?

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:10.560
Let me tell you, Li Ling,

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:11.680
I can toy with you.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:12.810
I can save you

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.380
or kill you just as easily.

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:15.240
In my eyes,

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.920
whether you fight openly or scheme in secret,

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.320
all your power struggles are meaningless.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.240
If you insist on stopping me,

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:23.520
even if it means dying together,

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.180
I'm willing to pay that price.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:29.920
This is the antidote.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:30.880
After taking it,

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.540
it will take half an hour for the poison to clear.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.060
I will definitely enter the Chen residence.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.200
If you continue like this,

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.530
we'll see what happens.
