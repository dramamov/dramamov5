WEBVTT

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.920
Wei.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.660
Then let me ask about your true feelings.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.200
Have you ever trusted me?

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.800
Was there ever a moment

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.800
when you truly valued me from the bottom of your heart?

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.360
I have my own mission.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:56.960
Keeping you by my side

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.570
would only harm you.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.050
I fear I can't protect you completely.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.879
Sister Yu.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.050
Everything Brother Ling said is true.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.640
After I left Chang'an, I went to Liangzhou to recover.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.640
I met Yanbo there.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.480
Then Brother Ling arrived.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.080
Yanbo told Brother Ling everything about you.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.530
From that moment on,

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.640
Brother Ling swore to protect you at all costs.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.900
As undercover agents,

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.960
we've long put our lives on the line.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.060
But do you know, Sister Yu,

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.200
before Brother Ling met you,

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.940
he had never been afraid of anything.

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:33.100
Surround them all!

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.729
Yes, sir!

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:35.560
Someone's coming.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.090
Get down!

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:43.720
Manager Xie.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.680
What are you doing here?

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.009
Fortunately, Lord Chen had a backup plan.

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:50.039
So you two

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.530
are the Tang army's secret agents.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.120
Don't you think

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.840
Wei Cheng's death

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.080
was too convenient?

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.280
I suspect Li Ling and Nongyu.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.930
If those two are truly up to something,

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.160
do you know what to do?

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.330
Don't worry.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.120
I'll show them

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.920
what a real living hell looks like.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.200
Nonsense!

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.400
Slanderous lies!

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.570
How could we possibly be spies?

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.040
Then why are you two together?

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.560
You should be following her.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.160
Nonsense!

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.720
He passed out.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.800
Can't I come up and ask about him?

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:32.720
As for you,

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.480
you've alerted the Tang army.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.970
Can you take responsibility for that?

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.340
Since I was ordered to follow you,

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.640
it means you're already under suspicion.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.800
So now whatever I say you are,

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.160
that's what you are.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.500
You're framing us!

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.640
You're right.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.640
I'll kill you first, then her,

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.380
and report that you were both Tang spies.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.440
I'll still complete my mission,

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:59.960
right, brothers?

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.600
Yes!

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.800
What? You want to fight me?

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.880
Is your blade faster than my crossbow?

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.880
One slight pull of my finger,

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.920
and you're dead.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.040
I'll shoot you with one arrow,

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.720
then your little lover.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.320
I have nothing to do with him!

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:21.520
Don't kill me!

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.530
Please spare me!

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.200
You have a grudge against him,

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.240
just kill him.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.960
I'll go back with you

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.040
and help identify him.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.040
Li Ling is the spy's accomplice,

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.760
you bitch!

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.200
You fickle woman!

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.860
Master Xie, shoot him!

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.660
I should have killed you with one stroke!

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:37.940
Shoot him quickly!

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.120
Attack!

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.920
Let's go! Retreat!

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.520
Brothers, don't let any of them escape! After them!

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.320
Yes!

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.160
Report!

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:21.120
Report!

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.920
What?

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.200
The strategic southern position has been taken by Tang forces.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.460
How could this happen?

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.560
I don't know either.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.800
During our shift change,

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.640
someone came with orders from the Prefect

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:32.500
to relocate us,

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.100
and the Tang army moved in.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.400
Sir!

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:45.690
How does it feel?

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:46.740
Satisfied now?

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.530
Still died by your hand.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.640
Our A-Qi really has impressive skills.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.770
Even flaying him alive would be too merciful.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:56.440
It hurts!

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.540
This little pain bothers you?

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.080
Miss Yu,

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:01.890
may I have a word?

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.890
What is this?

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.840
It's a letter I presented to Dr. Li.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.970
Why give it to me?

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.600
Because this letter was written for you.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.760
Li Ling consulted me many times about your situation.

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:29.890
I agreed to help him.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.800
This time, eliminating Wei Cheng,

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.320
obtaining the city defense map,

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.780
and helping the Tang army.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.560
You.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.490
Clearly played a crucial role.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.520
I have already written in this letter

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.250
to plead your case to the court.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:42.640
With this letter,

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.960
if you truly have been wronged,

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.280
Doctor Li will surely help you

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.620
uncover the truth.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.170
He will bring justice for your unjustly killed parents.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.240
You mean

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.400
you want me to deliver this letter to Doctor Li myself?

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.680
The Tang army has recaptured many territories now,

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.240
and Chang'an will soon be in turmoil.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.640
In these troubled times,

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.920
seeking advantage and avoiding danger,

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.520
staying away from conflicts

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.400
is your wisest choice.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.800
As for your future life,

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.280
with your merits,

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.920
the Tang Dynasty will certainly treat you well.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:21.440
So?

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.080
Are you satisfied

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.060
with these arrangements?

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.480
You've thought of everything for me, haven't you?

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.880
Thank you for your trouble, Master Zhuang.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:30.960
What's wrong?

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.740
Are you not satisfied?

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.860
I heard from Li Ling

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.920
that you joined them so Guantian Society would help

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.050
avenge your family.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.120
But now it seems

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.810
it's not that simple, is it?

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.900
Could it be you want to return to the Chen mansion

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.520
for that 'Night Fireflies' map?

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:55.580
If that's the case,

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.440
what then?

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.480
If that's true,

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.160
then you and we are not on the same side.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.010
Not on the same side?

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.160
So what?

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.520
If we're not aligned,

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.540
Li Ling will eventually be harmed by you.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.000
And I must protect him.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:12.290
Protect him?

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.800
I just bandaged that. Don't mess with it.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.040
How will you protect him?

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.760
The same way you 'protected' A-Qi?

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.020
By giving me poison to send me to my death?

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.400
Since we're not on the same side

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.060
and not walking the same path,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.120
you'd better go back.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.040
Don't think that because you've done some good

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.770
you can take liberties with us.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:35.880
I'll go check.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.020
Zhuang Yao.

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:46.200
What's wrong?

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:46.800
Zhuang Yao

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:47.360
Nongyu

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.400
Why are you suddenly arguing?

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.480
Li Ling, tell me,

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:51.640
did you just try to send me away

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.000
because you conspired with this Zhuang person?

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:54.680
That's right.

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.140
We did conspire together.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.400
The great cause of Li Tang cannot be delayed.

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.120
How can we let an outsider interfere?

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.380
She is not an outsider.

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.120
She is our comrade in resisting the rebels.

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.920
And restoring the Tang Dynasty.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.140
She is also an excellent warrior.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:13.060
Nongyu,

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.280
I apologize for my actions.

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.640
Although I was concerned for your safety,

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:20.370
I shouldn't have made decisions for you on my own.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.620
Nor should I have ignored your value.

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:25.880
Stop talking.

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:26.760
I need to say this.

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:28.890
Since I infiltrated the Chen mansion,

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.440
I never accomplished anything significant

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:32.520
until I met Nongyu.

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:35.320
Together we rescued Aqi,

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:36.720
eliminated Wei Cheng,

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.880
obtained the defense map to assist the Tang army,

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.539
and today's butchering task.

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.039
All these achievements,

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:44.640
without Nongyu sacrificing her personal interests for the greater good,

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.840
we could never have accomplished them.

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:53.560
To me, Nongyu is

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.640
nothing less than heaven-sent.

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:57.680
Without her,

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.540
I would be like a bird with clipped wings.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.760
There has never been a moment

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.970
when I needed her more than now.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:08.730
If she goes, I go.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:10.290
If she stays, I stay.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:13.000
Li Ling!

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.890
I asked her to leave not just for your sake,

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.040
but also to make our future operations easier.

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:21.120
You now carry the fate of the Tang Dynasty on your shoulders.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.640
The responsibility for millions of citizens,

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.920
yet here you are, all for one woman.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.000
You betray the court's mission.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.260
And all these years

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:32.280
of my earnest expectations for you!

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:42.840
Li Ling.

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:52.180
We will complete our mission.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.130
Let's go.

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:04.400
By the looks of it,

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.280
we won't be able to leave anytime soon.

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.080
Let's just make do here tonight.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:13.240
What's wrong?

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.520
Has your wound opened again?

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.240
Wounds can easily get infected when exposed to blood.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.900
Let me take a look at it for you.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.330
Don't worry.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.200
My lips aren't poisonous today.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.220
I'll go check on the medicine.

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:22.210
