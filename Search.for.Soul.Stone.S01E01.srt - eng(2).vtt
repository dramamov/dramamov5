00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.000
Boss, we've found the Meng Jia.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.960
Do it.

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:13.039
Leave no one alive except the child.

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:14.640
Yes.

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:29.320
Brother Meng.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.480
You were hard to find.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.159
My condolences.

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:46.679
Shen Tianyi.

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:49.479
You talk about honor and virtue.

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:51.119
But for the Soulstone in jadeite,

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:52.399
you'll do anything.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.640
You and your masters can go to hell.

00:01:07.239 --> 00:01:08.079
Look.

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:11.280
The masters truly favor you.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.640
Your clan doesn't need Soulstone energy

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.040
to have powers.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.560
You can grow stronger.

00:01:17.879 --> 00:01:22.680
They gave your family the gift to sense Soulstones.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.439
But people like us

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:26.680
have to scavenge like hyenas

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.159
for Soulstones in jadeite

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.760
just to survive.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.560
Just to keep our powers.

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:47.159
Yan'er!

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.599
Run!

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.960
I heard

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.280
your child inherited

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.879
the Meng Jia's powers.

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.479
If you won't cooperate,

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:19.759
we have him.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.439
It's the same.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.639
Where is he?

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.719
Are you blind?

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.680
He's right here.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.840
There's no one here.

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:37.280
Can't even watch a kid.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.240
I see the boy.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.479
Over there! Stop!

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.080
Stop!

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:52.800
Don't let him escape!

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:55.280
Stop!

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:00.199
He's up ahead.

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.000
Half a century ago,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.759
in Myanmar's jadeite mines,

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:12.439
Soulstones with mystical energy appeared.

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:15.159
Jadeite with mystical energy

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:17.199
can unlock life's potential.

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:18.719
Some humans

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:21.360
gained all kinds of powers.

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:23.840
The Gifted are ranked

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.479
from D, C, B, A to S class.

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:33.560
They can use jadeite's energy

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.039
to level up their powers.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.360
But our Meng Jia

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.800
could sense Soulstone veins,

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.039
and suffered disaster.

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:58.159
Boss, the kid ran off!

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:00.280
You didn't find him?

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.159
Boss, spare me!

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:01.960
Boss, please!

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:02.680
Boss, have mercy!

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.280
Boss.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.280
Keep searching.

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:10.319
Yan'er, run!

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:12.199
Stay alive.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.080
If you're not S class,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.800
you must hide yourself well.

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:20.560
Level up.

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:22.959
But months have passed.

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:26.240
I only know a little mind reading and control.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.839
Our Meng Jia's psychic sense—

00:04:28.959 --> 00:04:30.680
how do I level it up?

00:04:34.519 --> 00:04:35.759
This little girl—

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:38.959
why does she trigger my energy?

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.319
I sense a faint increase.

00:04:54.519 --> 00:04:55.959
Near this mute girl,

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.680
my energy is slowly growing.

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:05.959
My name is Meng Yan.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.040
What's your name?

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.319
She has no powers.

00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:20.079
Why can't I read her mind?

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:27.519
I see a little flower on your chest.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.560
I'll call you Xiao Duo.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.360
Xiao Duo.

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:36.759
Will you be my little sister?

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:39.199
With her,

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:41.360
I'm even harder to find.

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:54.079
Boss.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.639
Why are these bottles so heavy?

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:18.519
Forty-five cents.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.160
My mind control power seems stronger.

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:35.079
The Jadeite King Meng Jia fire incident

00:06:35.079 --> 00:06:36.439
was six years ago.

00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:38.279
Recently, news broke

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:41.040
Meng Jia's top jadeite relic has resurfaced.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.160
It's about to be auctioned.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.680
Good afternoon, everyone.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.480
I'm your auctioneer today.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.439
Behind me

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:48.759
is a mid-century antique.

00:06:48.959 --> 00:06:51.360
Starting bid: three hundred thousand dollars.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.959
Each raise: fifty thousand dollars.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.959
Let the bidding begin.

00:06:55.959 --> 00:06:57.120
Three hundred fifty thousand.

00:06:57.319 --> 00:06:58.639
Alright, three hundred fifty thousand here.

00:06:58.639 --> 00:06:59.519
Four hundred thousand.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.920
Alright, four hundred thousand here.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.480
Any higher bids?

00:07:02.519 --> 00:07:03.279
Four hundred fifty thousand.

00:07:03.399 --> 00:07:05.079
Alright, four hundred fifty thousand here.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.839
Anyone else want to bid?

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:07.360
Five hundred thousand.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.680
Alright, five hundred thousand here.

00:07:08.759 --> 00:07:09.399
Thank you.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.240
Any more bids?

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:23.279
Who are you?

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.560
Did you enter the wrong room?

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:26.439
Who are you, really?

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:28.519
I'm talking to you.

00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:29.480
What are you doing?

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.360
Leave now or I'll call security.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.160
Pour me some tea.

00:07:34.439 --> 00:07:35.360
Why should I serve you tea?

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:02.759
You're one of the Gifted.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.160
What are you here for?

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.720
Lot number 027.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.600
How did you get it?

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.680
Our auction house has rules.

00:08:15.759 --> 00:08:17.399
We never reveal client info

00:08:17.839 --> 00:08:18.879
or item origins.

00:08:19.199 --> 00:08:19.680
Rules.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.720
You auctioned our family's item

00:08:23.759 --> 00:08:25.279
without my permission.

00:08:25.279 --> 00:08:26.720
That's your rule?

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.360
Lot 027 is a Meng Jia relic.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.160
Meng Jia was wiped out six years ago.

00:08:36.279 --> 00:08:37.159
Are you...

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:41.679
Auction.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.120
Right?

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:45.879
Sold.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.240
Congratulations, sir.

00:08:47.399 --> 00:08:48.759
Please look at our next item.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.360
Lot 027, Meng Jia relic.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.639
Starting bid: one million dollars.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.919
Each raise: two hundred thousand dollars.

00:08:56.919 --> 00:08:58.840
Everyone, start bidding.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.480
Darn it, The Jadeite King!

00:09:11.039 --> 00:09:12.240
Such a precious Meng Jia treasure

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.360
has ended up out in the world.

00:09:13.759 --> 00:09:14.879
I bid three million.

00:09:15.759 --> 00:09:16.639
Three million.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.279
This gentleman has offered

00:09:18.279 --> 00:09:19.559
a price of three million.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.480
Anyone else want to raise the bid?

00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:22.600
Six years ago, Meng Jia was

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.360
Could this be bad luck?

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:27.679
That's just superstition.

00:09:28.039 --> 00:09:29.200
The media already said

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.639
it was just a fire.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:31.720
Four million.

00:09:31.759 --> 00:09:32.679
Four million.

00:09:32.879 --> 00:09:33.519
I bid five million.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.720
Five million, thank you.

00:09:34.879 --> 00:09:35.879
Any more bids?

00:09:36.279 --> 00:09:37.000
I bid six million.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.519
Alright, six million over here.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:39.919
I bid seven million.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.080
This gentleman bids seven million.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:42.960
Anyone else want to raise the bid?

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:44.879
Isn't that someone from Shen Jia?

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.279
They want this jadeite too.

00:09:46.879 --> 00:09:49.480
Don't mess with Shen Jia. Stop bidding.

00:09:53.519 --> 00:09:54.360
Seven point two million.

00:09:54.639 --> 00:09:56.559
This gentleman bids seven point two million.

00:09:56.759 --> 00:09:58.279
Any more bids?

00:10:01.759 --> 00:10:02.720
Seven point five million.

00:10:03.039 --> 00:10:03.960
Seven point seven million.

00:10:09.279 --> 00:10:10.480
Lot number 027.

00:10:10.559 --> 00:10:12.440
It's what Mr. Shen specifically requested.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:13.320
If you offend him,

00:10:13.679 --> 00:10:14.480
you'll regret it.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.960
Shen Tianyi, right?

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:19.960
He still wants Meng Jia's things.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.159
Good, I'm after him too.

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.720
Let's play with him today.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.279
Eight point five million.

00:10:28.279 --> 00:10:28.879
Eight hundred...

00:10:28.879 --> 00:10:29.559
Eight point seven million.

00:10:30.279 --> 00:10:32.279
This gentleman bids eight point seven million.

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.240
If there are no higher bids,

00:10:34.559 --> 00:10:35.720
then this gentleman

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:39.039
will win lot 027 for eight point seven million.

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:42.720
Soulstone barrier.

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.639
He's one of the Gifted.

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:46.639
Fatso, you'd better watch yourself.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:48.240
Me?

00:10:48.519 --> 00:10:49.360
What did I say?

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:50.559
Not bad.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.679
You dare bid against Shen Jia.

00:10:53.159 --> 00:10:54.159
You've got guts.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:57.679
Mr. Shen

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.519
won't let you off.

00:11:02.279 --> 00:11:03.559
Won't let me off?

00:11:05.759 --> 00:11:07.360
Soon you'll tell me yourself

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.679
where this thing came from.

00:11:09.159 --> 00:11:11.480
And you'll hand it to me yourself.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.320
You brought this on yourself.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.679
What does it have to do with me?

00:11:15.759 --> 00:11:17.879
You think I'll tell you?

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.759
Eight point seven million, first call.

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.720
He's a hopeless gambler.

00:11:31.879 --> 00:11:32.480
Right?

00:11:32.919 --> 00:11:34.159
Any more bids?

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.240
How did you know?

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.320
Eight point seven million, second call.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:40.919
Witchcraft.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.120
We, Shen Jia, bid nine million.

00:11:45.279 --> 00:11:46.159
Nine million.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.919
Anyone else want to raise the bid?

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:49.279
This is bad.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.519
Nine million, first call.

00:11:51.399 --> 00:11:53.480
Nine million, second call.

00:11:53.679 --> 00:11:54.120
Nine hundred...

00:11:54.159 --> 00:11:54.799
Wait!

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.440
I'm making a Blank Check Bid!
