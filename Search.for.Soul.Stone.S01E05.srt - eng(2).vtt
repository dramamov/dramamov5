00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:50.640
Thank you, sir.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.959
Uncle.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.480
There's another problem.

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:09.959
Mm.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.120
The spirit power is too weak.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.760
Still nowhere near

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.400
what we found at the Meng family

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.480
with those jade stones back then.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.079
Daolang said before

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.760
it was the two young ladies from Jia and Tang

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.480
who saved Meng Yan.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.040
The younger generation of Tang and Jia

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.439
used to be two-faced,

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.200
but at least they called me uncle.

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.159
We all kept up appearances.

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.319
But this time,

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:45.480
they openly stand against me.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.640
Something strange is going on.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.640
There's Jia Yuer,

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.079
and Tang Yuyan.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.599
Only that old lady from Tang family

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:56.760
makes us a bit wary.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.359
As for the Jia family,

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.120
after the old man died,

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.359
just Jia Yaozu is left.

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:04.959
He's just a useless playboy.

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:07.400
His niece

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.759
even dares to mess up our plans.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.000
I heard Jia Yuer

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.759
started some Azure Dragon Gang.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.759
They keep coming after us.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.280
Uncle, you must be joking.

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:22.879
That Azure Dragon Gang

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.280
to us,

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.560
is just child's play.

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:09.120
Why are you here?

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.319
It's been six years.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.560
I have so much to tell you.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.159
No.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.240
Whatever it is, let's talk tomorrow.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.120
It's so late now.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.360
Do you know

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:26.919
some things can only be said at night?

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.360
Don't.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.879
Put on some clothes.

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:33.719
It's so cold.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.759
If you think I'm cold,

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.680
then come closer to me.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.919
Don't you like it?

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:44.120
I...

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.400
Stop messing around.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.639
This is Jia Yuer's house.

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:53.199
What,

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.240
I'm not enough for you?

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:58.919
You want her to join us?

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.479
What are you saying?

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:08.719
Come out, quick.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.840
He's such a flirt.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:20.839
Yuer.

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:22.519
You...

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:27.279
Meng Yan, you're so naughty.

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:30.920
How do you know some things

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.279
are more fun with three

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.839
than with just two?

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.279
You...

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.120
There's still a long time till dawn.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.680
Shh.

00:04:57.399 --> 00:04:58.319
Yuer, your hand...

00:05:05.959 --> 00:05:06.759
Wait, that's not right.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.079
Who are you really?

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.759
What are you?

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.480
Why doesn't my power

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.439
work on you?

00:05:23.519 --> 00:05:25.480
What we are doesn't matter.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.439
What matters is what you saw.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.000
What do you want?

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.959
You'll know soon.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.160
Meng Yan, get down!

00:06:00.959 --> 00:06:01.879
You...

00:06:03.959 --> 00:06:04.839
Are you okay?

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:06.519
Wait.

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:16.720
That dead toad

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:17.800
how did it show up here?

00:06:19.519 --> 00:06:20.720
Dead toad?

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.199
Mm.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.920
Yuer means the Puppetmaster Toad.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.399
He's now the most powerful

00:06:27.399 --> 00:06:28.839
puppetmancer in Dai.

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:31.720
Two years ago, he single-handedly

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.600
wiped out Dai's biggest gang.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.600
He became famous overnight.

00:06:35.519 --> 00:06:37.759
They say his puppetmancy is ever-changing.

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:40.360
No one can tell real from fake.

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:41.920
Rumor has it

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:42.759
he's always coveted

00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:45.040
the Jade Vein of the three clans in Myanmar.

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:47.160
Puppetmaster Toad.

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:51.279
That dead toad is always mysterious.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.160
But now it's fine.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.199
At least we know he's straight.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:57.959
How do you know?

00:06:58.519 --> 00:06:59.439
Look at those stockings.

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:01.120
Straight guy's taste.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.680
I wouldn't wear them anyway.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.079
But these puppets

00:07:06.079 --> 00:07:07.639
don't seem to have weapons.

00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:10.879
Doesn't look like they want to hurt Meng Yan.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:12.759
Oh no.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:13.720
Xiao Duo!

00:07:14.519 --> 00:07:15.079
Xiao Duo!

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.360
Isn't this your home address?

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.560
I'm going out for a bit.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.519
Wait here and be good till I return.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:50.720
Okay?

00:08:15.759 --> 00:08:16.839
Who are you?

00:08:18.839 --> 00:08:21.560
Who am I? Who are you?

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.560
All things are different.

00:08:30.959 --> 00:08:32.720
All things are the same.

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:42.639
It's you.

00:08:54.919 --> 00:08:57.120
Boss Jia, you've had too much.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.840
We're just getting started.

00:08:59.159 --> 00:09:00.120
You're annoying.

00:09:06.039 --> 00:09:06.639
Bottoms up!

00:09:07.399 --> 00:09:08.080
Boss Jia.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:08.759
Drink it all!

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.080
Clan leader.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:11.200
Come.

00:09:11.399 --> 00:09:11.919
Clan leader.

00:09:12.919 --> 00:09:13.440
Clan leader.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:15.919
Come.

00:09:16.679 --> 00:09:18.159
Clan leader.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.120
Let's go, sit over there.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.000
Clan leader.

00:09:51.639 --> 00:09:52.759
Yuyan hasn't come back yet.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.120
Not yet.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.639
Someone sent this over.

00:10:02.639 --> 00:10:04.960
That brat hasn't called all day.

00:10:06.159 --> 00:10:07.960
Doesn't even call home.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.159
Oh no.
