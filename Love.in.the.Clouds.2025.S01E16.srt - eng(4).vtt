00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.560
You don't need to spend any spiritual power on me.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.040
It's not worth it.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.840
I used Ruo Shui.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.070
I used her

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.870
to free myself from my own hatred.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.320
Next, I only thought about getting rid of her.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.600
I thought

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.720
I had shown enough goodwill

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.670
as long as I sent her away.

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.350
I never cared about her life at all.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.000
That's not it.

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.160
It's not like that.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.350
Ji Bozai.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.070
The people

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.510
Mu Qibai used to nurture the netherbeast army

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.320
were captured and thrown into the Sunken Abyss

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.000
alongside me.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.070
Most of them were old people, women, and children.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:15.350
There...

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.510
There were even people younger than me.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.550
They did not stand a chance.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.920
All of them were also innocent.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.070
However, they were branded as criminals wrongfully.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:41.790
Then,

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.830
they even became food for the netherbeast army.

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.920
If...

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.040
If I had not exposed Mu Qibai,

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.480
would they and Ruo Shui

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.720
still be alive?

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.320
But...

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.990
But...

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:21.920
But they are dead.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.550
It's all my fault.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.550
- It's all my fault. - That's not it.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.080
You can't blame yourself

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.480
for their deaths.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.520
This isn't your fault.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.230
I found the Golden Millet Dream.

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:35.160
However, he put a blood seal on it.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:37.640
I couldn't get it.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.870
A blood seal?

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.190
Then, he's the only one who can undo it.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.640
It seems like Ji Bozai is still wary of you.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:45.840
Then, we...

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.160
Ming Yi,

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:54.840
why are you crying?

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.040
Twenty-Seven.

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:59.110
I thought

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.750
I would be happy

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.350
when I found the Golden Millet Dream.

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.040
I should feel lucky

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.720
that I am able to find it here.

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:16.640
But...

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:29.040
That's enough from me.

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:30.280
Twenty-Seven.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.790
Right now, there's one thing we must do.

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:34.280
Destroy the netherbeast army

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.230
and deal with Mu Qibai, right?

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:38.790
What about you?

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.920
We can steal the Golden Millet Dream

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.640
and cure you first.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.080
Then, we'll have a greater chance of winning. Am I right?

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:51.040
Twenty-Seven,

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.040
if you were in my shoes,

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.310
who would you choose?

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:01.550
A bad person who is alive

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:03.110
or a good person who is dead?

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:06.920
Ming Yi,

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:11.750
I've always wanted you

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:13.790
to become a good person who's immortal.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.040
What do you mean by that?

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.480
You are a good cat who's immortal.

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:21.750
When all your teeth fall off,

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:23.080
you won't be able to eat any anchovies.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.920
Are you going to help me?

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.160
Think about it carefully.

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:44.640
You said yes so easily.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.230
You lost control of the Sunken Abyss.

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:17.480
It is only temporary.

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:20.640
On the surface, Sunken Abyss has been sealed off by Judgment Hall,

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:22.400
but no one knows

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.160
that the Soul-Consuming Tree is connected to it.

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.670
I've been staying in my place to feed the netherbeasts

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:27.960
for a few days.

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:30.310
So, there's no need to be anxious.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.590
We will surely succeed in ten more days.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.160
Lord Hanfeng,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.120
you must be mistaken.

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:40.670
You should feel anxious,

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:42.310
not us.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.710
If the Sunken Abyss isn't suitable for hatching netherbeasts,

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.830
there is no opportunity.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.280
I was careless.

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:53.880
All of this happened because of Ji Bozai.

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:57.360
I came here this time

00:08:57.830 --> 00:08:59.760
for Ji Bozai as well.

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:04.120
He does possess the Golden Millet Dream?

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:08.760
Ji Bozai eliminated two of my subordinates with his clever tricks.

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:09.880
He did everything

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.950
to avenge Bo Yulan.

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.550
He must have a close relationship with the Bo clan.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.400
You didn't answer my question directly.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.360
It seems like you really don't know

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.760
where the Golden Millet Dream is.

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:29.310
I have reasons to suspect

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:33.710
that you are also trying to protect Ji Bozai

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:36.280
so he can win the Qingyun Tournament one day

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:37.470
and become the best warrior of the Six Realms.

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:38.360
That way, the Jixing Abyss

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.160
can leave Zhushui Spiritual State for good.

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:43.670
I'm loyal to Zhushui Spiritual State.

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:44.830
Even if you're not,

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.120
your efforts are futile.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.830
No one

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:52.310
can alter

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:54.790
the results of the Qingyun Tournament.

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:03.280
Does Ji Bozai know about the netherbeast army?

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:07.310
Not yet.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:17.240
Jixing Abyss is such a terrible place.

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.360
Even the boat carriage can't move smoothly.

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:21.710
Shao Qun.

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:25.190
Maybe Lord Hanfeng can show us

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:27.640
how to pilot it properly.

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:33.160
Sure.

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:10.710
In less than ten days,

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:12.760
the netherbeast army will be ready.

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:15.310
We don't have much time left.

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:19.550
Everyone else thinks

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.880
the Sunken Abyss guarded by Judgment Hall

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:24.710
is where criminal immortals who did something atrocious get punished.

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:28.520
However, this place is full of poisonous miasma.

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:30.000
No one can set foot in it.

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:33.360
Mu Qibai wanted to use this place to make medicine,

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.160
but because he lacked the required formula,

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:36.920
he only made Heavenly Grief instead.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.190
By using the Soul-Consuming Tree,

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:41.950
he opened a shortcut to the Sunken Abyss

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.640
and turned it into his own medicine mill.

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:48.670
A place full of miasma

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.160
is not just suitable for making medicine,

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:51.950
but also for raising netherbeasts.

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:53.550
That was why Mu Qibai

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:55.360
chose this place to hatch netherbeasts

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:57.830
and captured all you innocent people

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.120
to work for him.

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:01.190
Their operational method

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:03.360
has never changed.

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:10.160
They capture orphans, widows, old people, and disabled people

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.190
and send them to the Sunken Abyss.

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:15.000
If they die, they die.

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:17.190
No one will fight for them.

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:18.830
Therefore, they have been searching

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:20.280
for people who are the same as me.

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.640
People who have no one to care about whether they live or die

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:26.400
because people like us

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.760
are the most suitable to be used

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:32.790
in their opinion.

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:49.760
Ming Yi, you said

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.920
if we wanted to eliminate

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.830
the nascent netherbeast army,

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:56.280
we could offer ourselves as netherbeast vessels

00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:58.880
to absorb the netherbeast core

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:00.240
and refine them.

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:04.240
Tell me.

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:08.310
How do I do this?

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.400
To use this skill,

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.950
you need a powerful person

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:17.280
to serve as a netherbeast vessel.

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:19.790
Leave this to me.

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:22.160
You are the warrior of Jixing Abyss.

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:23.160
Nothing can go wrong.

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:24.880
Since I've promised you,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.240
I'm willing to become the vessel.

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.120
You said

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.360
it'd only be successful

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:30.550
with someone powerful.

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:31.120
I...

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:32.590
I've seen you use a spell.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:33.880
You have limited spiritual power.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:35.470
Even if you have spiritual veins,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000
you still won't succeed.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.040
That is the reason

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.520
why I must become the vessel

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.520
so our strongest fighter can be available.

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.470
If something happens to you,

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:45.360
Mu Qibai will act immediately.

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:47.070
If we lose you,

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:49.070
how can we defeat him and the person behind?

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:50.670
How can I be hurt

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:52.640
from being a vessel?

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.040
But you...

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:55.400
It's decided.

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:00.880
There are three steps

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:02.710
before you become a netherbeast vessel.

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:05.710
The further you get, the more dangerous it is.

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:08.400
Step one,

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:11.640
cultivate your spiritual powers to strengthen your own core.

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:24.670
Step two,

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:27.640
absorb the netherbeasts to your core remotely

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:29.920
and you'll have a netherbeast core inside you.

00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:38.070
Step three,

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:39.710
use yourself as a vessel

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:41.400
to contain the netherbeast core

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:42.790
and refine it.

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.160
This is the first stage.

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:49.120
You will exhaust all your spiritual power

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:50.360
and feel extremely weak.

00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:51.550
Remember

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:52.950
not to leave Wugui Sea.

00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:00.670
Is Ji Bozai really using himself as a vessel?

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:03.440
Does he not trust you

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.670
or not want you to be hurt?

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:07.150
He is currently cultivating in seclusion in the Spirit Well.

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:09.440
However, he has never said anything to me.

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:13.270
Instead of not trusting me,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.960
it's more probable to say that he doesn't want to see me hurt.

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:20.910
What he thinks of me now isn't important.

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:22.120
He must first pass the first stage.

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:23.870
This medicinal powder

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:25.360
can treat the wound on his hand.

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:27.080
I still need to make some nourishing medicine

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:29.150
to maintain his spiritual power at its strongest.

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.390
That's what we can do now.

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:42.440
Chief,

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:43.550
you're still not going back? It's late.

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:44.870
Everyone else has left.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:46.080
You may go back.

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:47.630
I'll leave after I review this.

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:48.440
Yes.

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:10.720
It has been a long time,

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:12.910
my dear younger brother.

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:31.870
You've been

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.120
doing very well,

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:36.080
and things have been getting better.

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:39.600
[Situ Ling, Chief of Judgment Hall in Jixing Abyss]
It's not worth it to come here

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:41.150
especially for me.

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:42.240
[Chao Yuan, Third Prince of Zhushui Spiritual State]

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:44.030
There must be a more important reason, right?

00:16:58.270 --> 00:16:59.480
It seems like

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:01.270
you'll never ever have spiritual veins.

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.550
You've been hiding in Jixing Abyss for so long

00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:06.160
yet you still haven't found the Golden Millet Dream.

00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:09.270
You're destined to be mediocre.

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:17.480
Since I'm here,

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.750
you can forget about searching for it.

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:24.350
You've not changed at all.

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:27.350
You only target people weaker than you.

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:28.550
Exactly.

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:30.550
You are the weaker one.

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:32.200
When it comes to this,

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:33.790
you've not changed as well.

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:44.540
[Clarity of Mind, Righteousness of Spirit]

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:04.790
You're still the same.

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:07.000
So boring.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:28.680
Fuyue.

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:30.400
I'm fine now.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:37.830
When Your Lordship finds the Golden Millet Dream

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:39.590
and gets your spiritual veins,

00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:42.550
you will no longer be humiliated in such a way.

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.680
Fuyue, like I said,

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:48.680
I don't want the Golden Millet Dream anymore.

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:49.590
Your Lordship,

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:52.070
can you prioritize yourself?

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:53.920
Is love so important?

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.550
Are you going to give up

00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:56.790
what you want

00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:57.720
and what you hate in life

00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.750
for a woman?

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:09.110
I've been keeping an eye on Mu Qibai for you for so long

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:11.310
and we finally have some progress now.

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:15.070
Are you really going to give the Golden Millet Dream to someone else?

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:18.480
What progress?

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:20.590
Do you have news of the Golden Millet Dream?

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:27.680
Mu Qibai

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:29.480
searched the whole Wugui Sea

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:31.480
and couldn't find the Golden Millet Dream.

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:33.640
I'm guessing

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:38.000
that perhaps Ji Bozai

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:41.070
can create a real Spirit Well

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:44.590
that only he can enter.

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:47.400
He then hid it in the well.

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:53.720
Spirit Well?

00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:57.720
Your Lordship wants to use the Golden Millet Dream

00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:58.830
to save Ming Yi,

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:02.310
but you've been exposed in the divine capital.

00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:05.350
Without spiritual veins,

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:07.790
do you think they will let you live?

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:09.680
Your Lordship,

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:12.200
what about the things you've always wanted to do?

00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:14.350
I can't bear to see you do this

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:15.550
for someone else.

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:16.640
But

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:19.920
there's only one Golden Millet Dream.

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:22.920
I can live without spiritual veins.

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:29.480
But Ming Yi will die without a cure.

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:31.440
Then...

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:34.830
can you do it for me?

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:41.640
It takes a lot of effort to capture you.

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:43.240
I heard

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:44.830
the more scared a fox is,

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:46.680
the shinier its pelt.

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:48.350
If I want to make a pelt out of you,

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:50.030
I must make you nervous

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.200
to sharpen the color.

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.880
Let's play a game.

00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:58.110
This game

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:01.200
will put me in danger?

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:03.200
How thrilling.

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:07.960
Your shamelessness

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:11.270
always reminds me of someone I hate.

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:12.110
Chao Yu.

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:17.110
Your whip is not that good.

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:19.160
I've healed

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.160
in less than three days.

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:33.160
Thanks to me,

00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:35.350
even a useless person like you with no spiritual veins

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:36.480
has gotten cocky.

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:38.680
You're more resistant to whips now.

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:44.070
You have no spiritual veins

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:45.400
yet you learned something new.

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:46.640
Isn't that good?

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:27.720
Are you hurt?

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:31.110
Why didn't you run?

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:35.440
Dumb fox.

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:45.440
If you are doing this to pity me,

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:47.030
stop crying.

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:48.920
When I can

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:51.240
change all of this

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:54.160
and celebrate my victory one day,

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:56.480
you may cry.

00:22:57.880 --> 00:22:58.720
But...

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.200
Are you trying to say

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:03.070
that I'm weak now?

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:05.310
I know that.

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:08.240
I'm still far too weak now,

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.640
but someone once told me

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:13.590
that if I could think about it,

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:16.790
I could make it happen.

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:25.720
It's the same.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:29.590
Think about it first

00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:31.070
and live on.

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:34.110
Nothing can stop us

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.350
in the future.

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:41.640
Even if you're just a little fox.

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:13.400
You are fond of Ming Yi,

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:15.640
but Your Lordship's life

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:18.480
is more important than anything else to me.

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:20.920
In the past, I'd do anything

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:22.200
you asked.

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:24.030
But this time,

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:26.400
for the first time in my life,

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:29.240

I will also think of a way

00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:37.070
to verify if Ji Bozai

00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:41.000
has created a real Spirit Well.

00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:06.160
I shouldn't disturb his rest.

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:19.270
Are you looking for me?

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:27.240
It's nothing important.

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:28.750
I figured

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:30.680
you should be weak

00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:32.070
after strengthening your core.

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:33.960
So, I brewed some medicine.

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:36.030
But it's okay.

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.590
Aren't you...

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:45.270
So,

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:47.070
can I appreciate

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:48.830
your goodwill or not?

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:51.750
Didn't you say

00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:53.960
you don't take food from outsiders?

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:55.480
You're still talking about this?

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:04.920
If I were someone else,

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:06.400
he would think

00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:08.350
that you were trying to poison him,

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:11.030
but you changed your mind because you had a moment of kindness.

00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:11.960
And right now,

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:14.880
you are trying to talk

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:16.270
your way out.

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:17.240
Great.

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:18.920
You shouldn't drink this.

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:40.640
It's time to begin the second step.

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:42.480
You need to use a Teleportation Array

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:44.270
to send your core to the Sunken Abyss

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:46.110
and absorb the primordial spirits of all netherbeasts.

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:50.070
However, this step will expose the presence of the spellcaster.

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:51.880
Please teleport your core back

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:52.920
as quickly as possible.

00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:54.440
Otherwise, everything will be in vain.

00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:00.640
I sacrifice myself

00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:04.000
to summon the righteous aura.

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:14.030
Demons and evil spirits,

00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:18.920
seal.

00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:32.200
This way.

00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:40.440
Lord Jingxi, please take a look.

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:42.440
In three more days,

00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:44.310
the netherbeast army will be created.

00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:47.830
The number and power of the netherbeasts

00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:49.680
are on par with those

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:51.160
raised by the Spiritual Veins Fairies.

00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:53.830
I've been complaining

00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:55.200
that Jixing Abyss is a harsh

00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:56.920
and run-down place.

00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:00.030
However, this terrible place

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:02.590
actually has its use.

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:05.920
What?

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:09.200
How come all the netherbeast cores have been absorbed?

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:10.030
This is...

00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:30.270
Ji Bozai.

00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:31.550
Yes.

00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:32.880
Ji Bozai.

00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:34.110
It must be him.

00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:34.960
It must be Ji Bozai.

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:35.680
Useless!

00:31:37.790 --> 00:31:38.480
I didn't know

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:40.480
Ji Bozai knew the Netherbeast Refining Skill.

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:41.640
Otherwise,

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:43.200
I would've taken precautions.

00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:46.920
Lord Jingxi.

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:56.550
I shouldn't expect anything out of this place at all.

00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:59.680
A barren place that only produces trash!

00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:02.590
Search everywhere

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.680
and get me Ji Bozai!

00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:08.220
[Jade Rabbit Hall]

00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:12.580
[Gudiao]

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:18.440
Your Highness, you should rest.

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:20.310
The Venerable of Shouhua Academy

00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:21.830
is not just a pretty trophy.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.640
I must remember everything

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:24.830
about the Qingyun Tournament.

00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:27.160
You have grown up, Your Highness.

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:33.200
I'm just afraid of losing again.

00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:41.070
Without the Blessed Rain,

00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:42.880
the plants of Jixing Abyss

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:44.720
will look dull.

00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:47.310
Xiuyun.

00:32:48.270 --> 00:32:49.550
I feel anxious often.

00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:53.790
Do you think the Blessing Flower Mother left behind

00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:55.750
will wilt again?

00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:57.400
Don't worry, Your Highness.

00:32:58.070 --> 00:33:00.440
Immortal Yanxian's method is useful.

00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:03.030
For so many years in the past,

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:04.750
we've not had Blessed Rain

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:06.440
yet it still blooms just fine.

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:32.550
Gentlemen.

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:35.480
We've been training day and night,

00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:37.550
yet the most important warrior,

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:38.880
Ji Bozai,

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.640
has not appeared for days

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:43.110
and abandoned Shouhua Academy.

00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:45.640
Why should we train anymore?

00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:48.350
What are we giving our lives for?

00:33:49.270 --> 00:33:50.160
- Yes. - That's right.

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:50.960
For what?

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:53.160
Qingyun Tournament is a team battle.

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:55.070
We need a leader

00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:56.830
who can lead the whole situation.

00:33:57.070 --> 00:33:58.030
Right now,

00:33:58.590 --> 00:34:00.350
someone like Ji Bozai

00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:02.480
has been chosen as a warrior

00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:03.680
and is cherished by Her Highness.

00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:05.480
Why should we still care?

00:34:05.790 --> 00:34:07.310
All of us should stop training!

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:08.630
Sun Liao is right.

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:10.030
If Ji Bozai doesn't show himself,

00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:11.320
he should not become a warrior.

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:12.030
That's right.

00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:12.880
If he's not here,

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:14.000
there's no need for us to train anymore.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:14.960
Yes. Why are we still training?

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:16.150
Don't say that.

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:19.480
Your Highness,

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:21.230
Sun Liao is causing trouble at Shouhua Academy.

00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:25.480
Who said you can skip training if Immortal Ji isn't here?

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:27.000
Immortal Ji is a warrior

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:28.030
but he is not the only one

00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:29.320
in Shouhua Academy.

00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:31.040
If he alone can decide

00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:33.590
if we win or lose in the Qingyun Tournament,

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:36.320
that means Jixing Abyss hasn't really become stronger.

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:41.000
Gentlemen,

00:34:42.070 --> 00:34:43.630
who's right?

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:46.670
Who's right?

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.630
Being loud doesn't mean you're right.

00:34:52.150 --> 00:34:53.070
I think

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.800
Immortal Sun Liao is right.

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:08.000
As a warrior,

00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:10.880
Ji Bozai is indifferent about Shouhua Academy.

00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:12.550
He doesn't care

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.630
about Jixing Abyss at all.

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:16.280
Yes. Her Highness is spoiling him.

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:17.110
He's right.

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:19.800
If Lord Hanfeng manages Shouhua Academy,

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:21.150
this will never happen.

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:22.280
Exactly.

00:35:24.070 --> 00:35:25.230
To Ji Bozai,

00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:27.150
fighting in the Qingyun Tournament as a warrior

00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:29.480
is just a way for him

00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:32.320
to get rid of his criminal status.

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:40.550
Is that Ji Bozai's aim?

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:43.280
No wonder.

00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:45.480
I've not been able to understand

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:49.070
why Ji Bozai won't come to train.

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:52.590
What you said has enlightened me, Immortal Sun Liao.

00:35:53.590 --> 00:35:54.630
Someone like him

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.480
is not fit to become a warrior of Shouhua Academy.

00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:58.440
- Yes. - Exactly.

00:35:58.440 --> 00:35:59.670
- That's right. - He's not worthy.

00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:00.400
Why don't

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:03.150
we elect another warrior?

00:36:03.370 --> 00:36:03.880
What?

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:05.000
Another warrior?

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:05.670
But who?

00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:06.880
It is an important position.

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:08.280
We must choose the right person.

00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:09.110
Yes.

00:36:09.110 --> 00:36:12.280
I think Immortal Sun Liao is a good choice.

00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:14.320
Me?

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:15.070
Your Highness.

00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:16.670
You must be joking.

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:24.360
As the Venerable of Shouhua Academy,

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:26.840
I don't joke about this.

00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:31.200
Immortal Sun Liao participated in the last Qingyun Tournament.

00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:33.700
He has more experience

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:36.060
compared to other people.

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:37.960
Moreover,

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:41.190
whether it's the warrior selection

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:43.400
or the training in Shouhua Academy,

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:45.960
Immortal Sun Liao has been very proactive

00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:47.230
and has an excellent attitude.

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:49.480
I hereby declare

00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:51.840
that Ji Bozai is stripped of his title of a warrior.

00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:53.960
Just like that?

00:36:54.070 --> 00:36:55.280
We'll lose for sure.

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:56.480
- Exactly. - She won't show mercy at all.

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:57.230
His title is stripped?

00:36:58.240 --> 00:36:59.700
- I'll elect Immortal Sun Liao - Her Highness has her reasons.

00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:01.150
- as Shouhua Academy's warrior. - Yes.

00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:03.360
Really?

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:04.440
Great!

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.030
I support Immortal Sun!

00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:07.150
I support Immortal Sun too!

00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:08.710
I...

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:10.240
- Sun Liao? - Sun Liao?

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:11.710
- Right. Is he capable? - Can he do it?

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:13.400
What's going on?

00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:15.000
Why do I think he's unreliable?

00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:16.920
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:19.070
Thank you.

00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:24.070
I was being short-sighted

00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:26.760
and only had eyes for Ji Bozai.

00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:28.280
Right now,

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:32.630
you are the more heroic one

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:36.030
who should carry the mantle of a warrior.

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.440
Ji Bozai isn't the best choice

00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:39.880
but Sun Liao...

00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:41.630
So we caused this ruckus

00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:43.000
just to help Sun Liao instead.

00:37:43.150 --> 00:37:44.840
- Yes. - He's unworthy.

00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:56.230
Immortal Sun Liao, please lead others in their training.

00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:59.070
If you do well,

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:01.960
I will tell Father.

00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:08.360
Of course.

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:10.110
Your Highness.

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:15.070
I made you the warrior

00:38:16.070 --> 00:38:17.320
and you're still addressing me as Your Highness?

00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:19.670
Shouldn't you call me the Venerable?

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:27.590
Why did Tianji do this?

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:29.190
No.

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:31.630
This is the best

00:38:32.590 --> 00:38:33.760
and the most efficient solution.

00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:34.480
Yes,

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:36.590
Venerable.

00:38:37.070 --> 00:38:38.280
Sun Liao is so arrogant

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:40.000
yet Tianji still promoted him.

00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:41.710
How humiliating.

00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:44.150
Is your pride that important?

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:46.480
It's fine as long as her goal can be achieved.

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:50.230
Deceit, lies,

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:52.070
and empty promises.

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:54.380
Instead of protecting Ji Bozai,

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:56.570
it's better to make Sun Liao

00:38:57.490 --> 00:38:59.130
the new target.

00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:23.350
Lord Hanfeng, why are you looking for me?

00:39:25.650 --> 00:39:27.150
What's wrong with this tree?

00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:29.000
It was healthy at first.

00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:31.280
It was surprisingly fragile.

00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:33.190
I took my eyes off it for a while

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:35.110
and it wilted in one night.

00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:37.840
Lord Hanfeng, you've been taking care of it meticulously.

00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:41.030
I was careless.

00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:43.670
Lord Hanfeng, don't be upset.

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:46.110
Lord Hanfeng,

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:48.190
I can bring you some of the best wine.

00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:49.440
It has

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:51.190
Zhaocui Dew added to it, which is endemic to Jixing Abyss.

00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:52.880
It tastes completely different.

00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:55.960
Endemic to Jixing Abyss?

00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:58.280
Yes. Jixing Abyss is the only place among the Six Realms that has it.

00:39:58.710 --> 00:40:00.920
The flower looks identical to a weed

00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:02.030
but on the full moon's night,

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:04.480
the world's purest dew will be condensed on the flower.

00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:07.920
I shouldn't expect anything out of this place at all.

00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:11.030
A barren place that only produces trash!

00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:20.320
These are the items cleared from the warehouse next door.

00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:21.440
There's not much use to them.

00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:22.760
How do you want to deal with them, Your Lordship?

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.400
Lord Hanfeng, this is...

00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:31.360
I almost forgot.

00:40:32.070 --> 00:40:33.440
Tianji gave this to me.

00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:34.840
Tianji?

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:37.400
That was a long time ago.

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:42.880
During those few years,

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:44.710
we still had

00:40:45.110 --> 00:40:46.230
a close relationship.

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:49.150
Tianji loved sweet food.

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:50.280
She wouldn't even

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:51.710
throw away a candy box.

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:53.360
She didn't want the emperor to find out

00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:55.670
so she asked me to keep it for her.

00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:59.920
That is because Tianji saw you as her support.

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:04.550
So, when I saw her working with Ji Bozai,

00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:06.960
don't you think that'd make me upset?

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:09.030
Not at all.

00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:10.760
She was just all talk.

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:11.960
She only thought

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:14.150
Ji Bozai looked mighty as a warrior.

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:15.880
Tianji's feeling for Ji Bozai...

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:18.400
That's impossible.

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:20.840
She doesn't like him.

00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:26.590
That makes me even more upset.

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:29.920
The little girl

00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:32.070
who came to me for protection

00:41:32.670 --> 00:41:33.960
is nowhere to be seen now.

00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:38.400
What will happen to her in the future?

00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:41.070
I will protect Tianji.

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:42.920
I won't let her get hurt at all.

00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:46.230
Even I can't say that confidently.

00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:50.190
Why would you not be confident?

00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:51.400
Ji Bozai.

00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:53.960
Who in Jixing Abyss

00:41:54.030 --> 00:41:55.920
knows about Ji Bozai's past?

00:41:57.400 --> 00:41:58.440
How come a criminal like him

00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:00.590
has spiritual veins?

00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:02.150
This alone

00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:03.920
is concerning,

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:05.230
let alone

00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:07.030
the changes that were brought

00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:08.320
to Jixing Abyss

00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:11.320
after he defeated Yaoguang Mountain and rose to fame.

00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:13.710
Is that so?

00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:15.440
Do you know?

00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:18.280
There were netherbeasts in Jixing Abyss not too long ago.

00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:21.400
I thought someone was making up rumors.

00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:23.280
It was actually true?

00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:26.800
I am investigating the truth.

00:42:27.550 --> 00:42:28.840
So, can you

00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:31.480
help me and Tianji

00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:34.070
clear all the dangerous obstacles?
