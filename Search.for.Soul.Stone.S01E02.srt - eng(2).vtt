00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:51.000
Nine million, second call.

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:51.560
Nine hundred.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.840
Wait a moment.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.200
Miss Tang is making a Blank Check Bid.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.599
What does that mean?

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.760
Blank Check Bid means—

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.519
No matter how much the other side offers,

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.879
she’ll always raise the bid again.

00:01:17.519 --> 00:01:18.640
Little girl,

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:21.000
this is something our Master Shen

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.560
really wants.

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:26.120
Then tell Uncle Shen

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:27.480
that this item

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.959
is something I, Tang Yuyan, really like.

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:30.599
I want to take it home and enjoy it for a few days.

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:32.719
If he wants it,

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.359
let him come ask me for it himself.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.719
So you’re Miss Tang.

00:01:39.239 --> 00:01:41.239
Forgive me for not recognizing greatness.

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:43.719
I’ll visit you another day.

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:45.239
Let’s go.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.239
Miss Tang bids nine point two million.

00:01:48.519 --> 00:01:50.079
Anyone else want to bid?

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:52.000
Sold.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.359
Congratulations, Miss Tang.

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:00.519
I’m already outside.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.040
Just wait for me at the door.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.159
Ruined my plan.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:15.639
It’s ruined.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.120
She has powers too.

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:19.520
I can’t control her.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.000
Hey kid, what’s wrong?

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:43.080
Did you get separated from your parents?

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.719
Come on.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.560
I’ll help you find your mom and dad.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.400
Trying to play games with me?

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.479
You—

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:20.439
Meng Yan.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:22.919
Tang Yuyan.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:34.960
Long time no see.

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:38.520
Where have you been all these years?

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:39.560
None of your business.

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:41.520
Who’s this little girl?

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:42.680
Did you get married?

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:43.960
Are you blind?

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.080
She’s my sister.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.960
Do you know how many years I’ve looked for you?

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.800
How many years have you looked for me?

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:57.719
When the Meng family had trouble back then,

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:59.520
it was in all the newspapers in Myanmar.

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.680
At that time—

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.159
why didn’t any of your families

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:03.360
step up and speak for justice?

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:05.280
Stay away from me, Miss Tang.

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:07.159
I’m dangerous right now.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.319
Then why didn’t you come find me back then?

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:13.520
You don’t even trust me?

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:16.000
It’s not about you.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.680
Why can’t you see what matters?

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:19.759
The point is, I’m dangerous now.

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:23.879
Forget it.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.839
Let’s go.

00:04:27.399 --> 00:04:28.519
What are you up to now?

00:04:28.519 --> 00:04:29.920
My lady.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.360
Then give me back the item.

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:32.920
Your Tang family’s Shadowcraft

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.519
doesn’t need this spiritual energy.

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:35.920
Why did you buy it?

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.360
I just saw

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:40.319
it belonged to your Meng family.

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:41.480
I thought I’d buy it

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:44.079
and maybe return it to you someday.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.120
Uncle, is it still not enough?

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.759
Lately, a lot of jade’s energy

00:05:15.959 --> 00:05:18.319
has mysteriously disappeared.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.959
If at the auction

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:25.519
we get the Meng family’s Mofei Jade,

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.519
we won’t need to keep

00:05:27.519 --> 00:05:30.120
searching for these inferior substitutes.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.160
I have failed you.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.439
You can’t even get things done

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:37.839
with money now?

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:40.920
I already spoke to the auction house owner.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.360
But then a fat guy showed up

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.639
and kept raising the price for no reason.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.639
Then Miss Tang showed up at the end

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:49.759
and made a Blank Check Bid.

00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:51.720
Still making excuses.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:53.720
Uncle.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.439
This jade vein is getting weaker.

00:05:56.759 --> 00:05:57.720
Why don’t we just take the Tang family—

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.319
Tang family matters aren’t your concern.

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:02.040
But I think—

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:03.160
Jingshi.

00:06:04.519 --> 00:06:08.439
Someday, you’ll be in charge of this family.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.920
Yes.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.519
Mr. Shen.

00:06:14.519 --> 00:06:16.240
I’m willing to make up for my mistakes.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.160
You useless fool.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.480
What’s the point of keeping you?

00:06:25.959 --> 00:06:27.480
Uncle, I was wrong.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.040
Uncle, I was wrong.

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:37.480
You—

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.319
Take some men and find the Meng family’s child.

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:41.120
Yes.

00:06:41.519 --> 00:06:42.519
With him,

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:45.519
we can find a new jade vein.

00:06:46.079 --> 00:06:47.360
It’ll save us a lot of trouble.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.160
Those ordinary people

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.759
only find worthless jade mines.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.439
There’s barely any spirit stones in them.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.839
So many years have passed.

00:06:57.519 --> 00:07:00.560
Are you sure Meng Yan is still alive?

00:07:01.519 --> 00:07:05.160
Only the Meng family can read people’s hearts.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.879
Unseen and unheard.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.839
They come and go freely.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.839
If I’m right,

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.560
the one causing trouble at the auction

00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:18.319
was Meng Yan.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:27.759
This is—

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.720
Xiaoduo’s health isn’t good.

00:07:30.759 --> 00:07:31.839
She needs spiritual energy to—

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.680
This belongs to our Meng family.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.519
I decide how it’s used.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:39.759
Tch.

00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:41.959
If it weren’t for a lousy gambler

00:07:41.959 --> 00:07:43.639
selling it to pay off debts,

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.319
you’d never have found it.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:46.920
Gambler.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.839
So you know where that gambler is?

00:07:54.839 --> 00:07:55.680
You want to find him?

00:07:56.759 --> 00:07:57.560
Yes.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.319
The jade came from him.

00:08:01.319 --> 00:08:02.439
Back then, what happened to our family—

00:08:03.279 --> 00:08:04.360
he must know something about it.

00:08:06.879 --> 00:08:08.160
I know what you’re after.

00:08:09.759 --> 00:08:11.079
I’ll take you to meet an old friend.

00:08:11.639 --> 00:08:12.639
She can help.

00:08:13.439 --> 00:08:14.079
Who?

00:09:13.159 --> 00:09:14.120
Sister Yuer

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.120
You don't recognize me now?

00:09:15.519 --> 00:09:16.759
You say he's Meng Yan

00:09:19.159 --> 00:09:19.840
How come?

00:09:20.639 --> 00:09:21.679
It's only been a few years

00:09:21.799 --> 00:09:23.039
and you can't recognize him?

00:09:24.799 --> 00:09:25.600
Forget it

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.480
Let's just go

00:09:28.039 --> 00:09:29.559
It's good enough if she doesn't cause trouble

00:09:32.159 --> 00:09:33.080
What does Meng Yan look like

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.159
Don't you remember at all?

00:09:35.679 --> 00:09:37.080
Lots of people look alike

00:09:37.879 --> 00:09:39.440
How do you prove he's Meng Yan?

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:40.759
Well...

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.559
He knows you

00:09:42.759 --> 00:09:44.120
Isn't that proof enough?

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:46.879
I know all the actresses on TV

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.120
But do they know me?

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:54.720
Knowing me means nothing

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.360
Unless he can prove it himself

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:03.720
If you really are Meng Yan

00:10:04.159 --> 00:10:05.279
then you should be able to dodge this
