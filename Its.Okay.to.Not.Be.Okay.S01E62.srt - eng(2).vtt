WEBVTT

00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:02.836
With the evidence we have,

00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:04.295
it seems like
Ma'am Olivia is your mother.

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:06.339
But Eden abandoned her child.

00:00:06.423 --> 00:00:08.299
That sounds more like my mother.

00:00:08.383 --> 00:00:09.718
You finally drew a butterfly.

00:00:09.801 --> 00:00:10.593
It's beautiful!

00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:11.845
Yes, doc.

00:00:11.928 --> 00:00:13.805
Please come to the book launch.

00:00:13.888 --> 00:00:15.223
Welcome, everyone.

00:00:15.306 --> 00:00:16.891
You really want everyone to see this?

00:00:16.975 --> 00:00:18.059
Yes.

00:00:18.143 --> 00:00:20.770
So I can find out
which one of them is my mother.

00:00:21.938 --> 00:00:22.772
Mia!

00:01:44.521 --> 00:01:45.939
She's all alone right now.

00:01:48.233 --> 00:01:50.527
Yes. I'll take care of her.

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:56.950
Where are you?!

00:01:58.743 --> 00:02:00.620
You picked the wrong witch to mess with!

00:02:00.703 --> 00:02:02.163
Uh, Miss Mia?

00:02:02.247 --> 00:02:03.957
You ruined my surprise!

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.627
Today was supposed to be a special day
where I would've presented that gift!

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.920
But what did you do?

00:02:09.504 --> 00:02:11.422
You decided to be idiots today!

00:02:11.506 --> 00:02:13.925
Your only job was to put
the photo I picked in a frame,

00:02:14.008 --> 00:02:15.051
and you failed to do that!

00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:17.262
Uh, Miss Mia,
I apologize for the inconvenience.

00:02:17.345 --> 00:02:19.639
But we were calling to inform you

00:02:19.722 --> 00:02:22.725
that we already
have the frame you wanted.

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:25.019
-Well, show me! Where is it?!
-Over here.

00:02:25.103 --> 00:02:26.437
That's it?! Well, let's go!

00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:27.689
Let's put it in the car.

00:02:27.772 --> 00:02:28.857
Let's go!

00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:33.820
Hurry up!

00:02:33.903 --> 00:02:35.446
Put that in my car!

00:02:36.072 --> 00:02:37.407
Faster!

00:02:58.136 --> 00:02:59.971
What are you doing here?

00:03:00.054 --> 00:03:01.472
I followed you.

00:03:01.556 --> 00:03:03.182
Who told you I'd be here?

00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:04.976
If the photographer hadn't called,

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:06.603
I wouldn't know you'd be here.

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:08.438
They said you weren't picking up.

00:03:08.521 --> 00:03:10.023
Those idiots.

00:03:10.106 --> 00:03:12.650
They ruined my surprise.

00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:14.903
Mia, the surprise isn't important.

00:03:14.986 --> 00:03:16.988
You shouldn't leave without telling us.

00:03:17.071 --> 00:03:18.448
We were all worried about you!

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:20.283
Oh, please. I was only gone for a while.

00:03:20.366 --> 00:03:21.951
You should've asked
someone to come with you.

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:23.202
What if something happened to you?

00:03:23.286 --> 00:03:24.537
I'm fine, aren't I?

00:03:24.621 --> 00:03:25.705
I'm all in one piece.

00:03:25.788 --> 00:03:26.706
Mia.

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:28.082
Patrick, chill.

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:29.292
I'm fine.

00:03:29.751 --> 00:03:31.044
-Give me your keys.
-Why?

00:03:32.086 --> 00:03:33.046
I'll drive for you.

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:35.340
What about your car?
You'll just leave it here?

00:03:35.423 --> 00:03:37.217
I'll tell security to come get it.

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:38.760
Why?

00:03:38.843 --> 00:03:40.929
Because you shouldn't be left alone.

00:03:41.638 --> 00:03:43.097
Did I make you worry?

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:54.484
I did.

00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:55.526
Get in.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:56.736
And I love it.

00:04:07.956 --> 00:04:09.916
Okay. Okay, good.

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:11.376
Good.

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.169
Thank you, thank you.

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:14.254
Okay.

00:04:15.213 --> 00:04:16.506
Everything's okay. Mia's okay.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:18.466
Mia's safe. She's with Patrick now.

00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:21.678
I'm glad to hear that.

00:04:23.388 --> 00:04:24.764
So…

00:04:25.682 --> 00:04:26.766
what now?

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:29.477
Can we get back to eating upstairs?

00:04:29.852 --> 00:04:32.063
Can we get back to having fun now?

00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:35.108
Let's go!

00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:40.196
Is this okay?

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.739
A little more to the right.

00:04:41.823 --> 00:04:43.616
-Like this?
-A little more.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.493
-Perfect, perfect.
-Like this?

00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:49.038
Oh, look!

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:51.749
Matmat has a happy face.

00:04:51.833 --> 00:04:54.502
That's right, Matmat.
You look happy there.

00:04:54.585 --> 00:04:56.713
Hmm, of course.

00:04:56.796 --> 00:04:58.965
I made sure that he would be comfortable.

00:04:59.048 --> 00:05:00.300
Right, Matmat?

00:05:01.884 --> 00:05:03.344
Shall we get some rest now?

00:05:04.095 --> 00:05:06.556
Hmm, good night, Patpat.

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:08.182
Good night, Mia.

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:09.642
-Good night, Matmat.
-Good night.

00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:17.859
What about you?

00:05:17.942 --> 00:05:19.235
You don't want to rest?

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:22.530
Something's missing.

00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:24.991
Huh?

00:05:25.074 --> 00:05:27.785
Don't tell me you'll
bother the studio people again.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.538
I think…

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:35.668
this photo is
missing some "little Patricks."

00:05:37.045 --> 00:05:38.046
Huh?

00:05:38.921 --> 00:05:40.089
We need to "talk."

00:05:41.674 --> 00:05:43.009
Mia, I'm tired.

00:05:43.092 --> 00:05:44.761
You had me worried all day, remember?

00:05:44.844 --> 00:05:46.637
Let's get some rest.

00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:48.973
But I really want some "little Patricks."

00:05:49.057 --> 00:05:50.683
Mia, don't be stubborn.

00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:53.436
Let's get some rest.
You have an early book launch tomorrow.

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:54.937
But the night's still young.

00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:57.231
We still have lots of time to "talk."

00:05:57.315 --> 00:05:58.858
Mia, good night.

00:06:25.676 --> 00:06:27.845
Promise me you won't do that again?

00:06:27.929 --> 00:06:29.806
You won't just suddenly disappear?

00:06:31.766 --> 00:06:33.017
I promise.

00:06:37.438 --> 00:06:38.439
Come on.

00:06:39.148 --> 00:06:40.191
Let's go.

00:06:40.274 --> 00:06:42.276
Let's make a bunch of "little Patricks."

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:44.070
Please?

00:06:45.738 --> 00:06:46.739
Good night.

00:06:50.535 --> 00:06:51.661
Get some rest.

00:07:08.302 --> 00:07:09.470
Madeth?

00:07:09.554 --> 00:07:10.763
Huh!

00:07:10.847 --> 00:07:12.390
The setup's not done yet?

00:07:13.182 --> 00:07:16.310
Incompetence is so unreal. Madeth!

00:07:20.022 --> 00:07:21.107
Hey.

00:07:22.066 --> 00:07:23.067
Water.

00:07:23.734 --> 00:07:25.236
Don't be stressed!

00:07:25.319 --> 00:07:28.239
The setup is nice.
All your efforts have paid off.

00:07:28.948 --> 00:07:30.283
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

00:07:31.325 --> 00:07:34.162
You know what,
it's different when you say it.

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:37.623
I don't feel stressed anymore.

00:07:37.707 --> 00:07:39.459
It's gone.

00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:44.464
Hmm.

00:07:45.214 --> 00:07:47.884
When this is all over,
you'll go back to Manila.

00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:49.135
Hmm.

00:07:50.094 --> 00:07:52.889
We'll be busy in Manila because I know

00:07:52.972 --> 00:07:57.351
Mia's new book will be a best seller.

00:07:58.269 --> 00:08:01.063
But I didn't say I'm leaving Maravida.

00:08:02.273 --> 00:08:04.150
-Did I?
-Hmm?

00:08:08.696 --> 00:08:11.866
I'm not leaving Maravida because…

00:08:12.617 --> 00:08:13.701
Because?

00:08:14.827 --> 00:08:17.705
Because my favorite writer is in here.

00:08:17.788 --> 00:08:19.999
Not only that, of course,

00:08:20.082 --> 00:08:22.960
Mia is very inspired
to write here in Maravida.

00:08:23.044 --> 00:08:26.506
Second, the cost of
living here is cheaper.

00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:29.842
Third, office spaces are also cheap.

00:08:29.926 --> 00:08:31.844
Right? Why would I leave?

00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:34.555
That's it?

00:08:35.932 --> 00:08:37.725
Those are your only reasons?

00:08:40.561 --> 00:08:42.480
I'm not leaving Maravida…

00:08:45.107 --> 00:08:46.359
because Gemma,

00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:49.612
I love you.

00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:01.123
Uh, Mama Li. I need to go to Mama Li.

00:09:16.514 --> 00:09:18.307
G-Gemma! Wait! I'm coming with you!

00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:20.142
Hey! Wait for me!

00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:30.695
What's wrong with me?

00:09:33.948 --> 00:09:34.991
What is it?

00:09:36.075 --> 00:09:37.076
Are you okay?

00:09:38.786 --> 00:09:40.246
I don't feel anything.

00:09:41.706 --> 00:09:42.707
It's like,

00:09:43.332 --> 00:09:44.625
It didn't even hurt.

00:09:46.252 --> 00:09:47.587
Are you sure?

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:49.797
Yeah. Give me your hand.

00:09:51.007 --> 00:09:52.300
Oh.

00:09:52.383 --> 00:09:53.926
See? Nothing.

00:09:55.177 --> 00:09:56.762
Maybe because--

00:09:56.846 --> 00:10:01.684
Maybe because
I already feel loved by you.

00:10:01.767 --> 00:10:03.144
You and Matmat.

00:10:04.353 --> 00:10:05.688
Jason, that's not because of us.

00:10:06.564 --> 00:10:07.982
You're not hurting,

00:10:09.191 --> 00:10:11.068
because you already like someone else.

00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:16.866
You know what I want?

00:10:18.409 --> 00:10:20.578
I want you to follow your heart.

00:10:23.998 --> 00:10:26.042
Hi, everyone. I'm Vincent Romulo.

00:10:26.125 --> 00:10:27.710
And I'm very happy to see

00:10:27.793 --> 00:10:30.254
our friends and
family gathered here tonight.

00:10:30.338 --> 00:10:33.341
Doc Anok, thank you very
much for allowing us to witness

00:10:33.424 --> 00:10:37.011
and celebrate
Mia Hernandez’s latest creation.

00:10:37.803 --> 00:10:41.015
With illustrations by Matthew Gonzales.

00:10:41.098 --> 00:10:42.391
Entitled

00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:44.727
"Nakita Mo Ba Ang Mukha Ko?"

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:51.651
Go, Matmat!

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:58.949
Have you seen my face?

00:11:02.286 --> 00:11:06.916
"Once, in a castle in
the middle of the woods,

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:12.713
there lived three people
who didn't have real faces."

00:11:14.215 --> 00:11:19.512
"One is named Mister Box.
He wears a box in his head.

00:11:19.595 --> 00:11:24.558
There's also Mask Boy.
A boy who always wears a mask.

00:11:24.642 --> 00:11:26.477
And then there's Princess Wapa.

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:31.190
This princess shows
no flicker of emotion at all."

00:11:31.899 --> 00:11:34.110
"They don't have faces

00:11:34.193 --> 00:11:40.658
because the shadow witch,
Bruhanino, stole them.

00:11:41.826 --> 00:11:43.911
Because they don't have faces

00:11:43.994 --> 00:11:47.581
and can't tell how each other feels,

00:11:48.582 --> 00:11:53.671
they often get into
misunderstandings and fights."

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:57.591
"O-One day,

00:11:57.675 --> 00:12:01.095
Mister Box said,

00:12:02.012 --> 00:12:06.892
"If we want to stop fighting

00:12:06.976 --> 00:12:10.312
and achieve happiness,

00:12:10.396 --> 00:12:15.943
we need to get our faces back."

00:12:16.944 --> 00:12:21.866
"Mister Box, Mask Boy,

00:12:21.949 --> 00:12:27.079
and Princess Waba
drove in their car and traveled,

00:12:27.163 --> 00:12:31.584
in hopes of finding their true faces."

00:12:32.168 --> 00:12:33.586
"One day,

00:12:34.211 --> 00:12:37.089
sitting along by the shore,

00:12:37.798 --> 00:12:40.468
there was a mother dog."

00:12:41.093 --> 00:12:44.221
"Miss, have you seen my face?"

00:12:44.305 --> 00:12:46.015
"The mother dog shook her head.

00:12:46.098 --> 00:12:50.519
Mask Boy noticed that she was crying.

00:12:50.603 --> 00:12:51.812
He asked,

00:12:51.896 --> 00:12:53.564
"Why are you crying?"

00:12:55.649 --> 00:12:58.694
"I was looking for food
for my child and me to eat!

00:12:58.777 --> 00:13:00.946
But I didn't see that she got away.

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:03.365
She was just behind me."

00:13:03.449 --> 00:13:05.701
"The mother dog kept crying.

00:13:05.784 --> 00:13:09.705
The sand beneath her was
starting to get wet with tears.

00:13:10.289 --> 00:13:12.583
Mask Boy then started crying."

00:13:13.167 --> 00:13:15.794
"Hu-hu-hu! Hu-hu-hu!"

00:13:16.212 --> 00:13:19.256
"His tears fell on the sand.

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:22.885
The puppy that mother dog
was looking for suddenly appeared."

00:13:23.344 --> 00:13:26.514
"The sun was scorching hot,

00:13:26.597 --> 00:13:29.683
that the puppy fell weak

00:13:29.767 --> 00:13:33.395
and was covered by the sand.

00:13:33.938 --> 00:13:39.902
The mother dog
hugged her puppy with glee."

00:13:47.743 --> 00:13:51.038
"The three continued their journey.

00:13:51.121 --> 00:13:52.790
Not long after,

00:13:52.873 --> 00:13:58.921
they saw a clown
dancing in a field of thorny flowers.

00:13:59.004 --> 00:14:02.883
"Hey, clown! Can you see my face?"

00:14:02.967 --> 00:14:05.970
"I can't see anything
because I'm dancing."

00:14:06.053 --> 00:14:07.388
The clown replied.

00:14:07.471 --> 00:14:10.933
Because of curiosity,
Princess Waba asked,

00:14:11.016 --> 00:14:13.185
"Why are you dancing without clothes

00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:15.604
when you could get pricked by thorns?"

00:14:16.564 --> 00:14:19.483
"This is the only way
people will notice me."

00:14:21.026 --> 00:14:23.487
"Because even though I'm hurting,

00:14:23.571 --> 00:14:25.823
no one's looking at me."

00:14:29.368 --> 00:14:34.373
Princess Waba
stepped into the thorny field

00:14:34.456 --> 00:14:36.208
and danced with the clown.

00:14:36.292 --> 00:14:38.711
"My body is made of tin,

00:14:38.794 --> 00:14:43.299
so I won't get hurt
even if the thorns prick me."

00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:53.142
"As the thorns struck the tin,

00:14:53.225 --> 00:14:55.978
Princess Waba's body made sounds".

00:14:56.061 --> 00:14:58.022
"When people heard the sound,

00:14:58.522 --> 00:15:01.525
they began to gather.

00:15:01.609 --> 00:15:04.153
They started watching them dance.

00:15:04.236 --> 00:15:08.866
And gave them loud applause.

00:15:09.408 --> 00:15:16.123
But suddenly,
the evil Bruhanino appeared before them.

00:15:17.708 --> 00:15:19.919
"You two,

00:15:20.002 --> 00:15:26.175
you'll never find
your happy faces again."

00:15:26.967 --> 00:15:28.510
-"After that"--
-"After that"--

00:15:31.055 --> 00:15:32.848
-"They were locked up by"--
-"They were locked up by"--

00:15:32.932 --> 00:15:33.974
Matmat…

00:15:34.475 --> 00:15:38.145
M-Mia, it's Matmat's turn to read.

00:15:38.228 --> 00:15:39.855
Matmat, it's my turn.

00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:42.107
I'm not done reading yet.

00:15:42.191 --> 00:15:44.193
You're so stubborn, Mia.

00:15:44.276 --> 00:15:45.945
Let me finish first.

00:15:46.028 --> 00:15:48.113
We've got noodles
and spring roll over there.

00:15:51.867 --> 00:15:53.702
-Why?
-Why did you even join?

00:15:53.786 --> 00:15:55.496
-It should just be me.
-Mia's so noisy.

00:15:55.579 --> 00:15:56.789
I should be the only one here.

00:15:56.872 --> 00:16:00.042
-Patpat, let go--
-You're the illustrator, I'm the writer.

00:16:04.546 --> 00:16:06.256
We're family, right?

00:16:07.216 --> 00:16:10.469
And family, love each other.

00:16:11.303 --> 00:16:14.098
We don't hold
grudges when we get annoyed.

00:16:18.686 --> 00:16:25.442
Mia is still Matmat's family,
even when we fight, because…

00:16:28.946 --> 00:16:30.614
I love Mia.

00:16:30.698 --> 00:16:34.785
Matmat loves his…

00:16:35.703 --> 00:16:36.829
family.

00:16:40.791 --> 00:16:41.709
Hmm?

00:16:52.219 --> 00:16:54.304
You're my family too, Matmat.

00:16:59.393 --> 00:17:00.602
There!

00:17:00.686 --> 00:17:02.062
Now give each other a hug.

00:17:12.364 --> 00:17:13.365
Let's go.

00:17:19.455 --> 00:17:21.206
We're good now, Mia.

00:17:32.426 --> 00:17:36.972
Now's the time
to show who you really are.

00:18:17.304 --> 00:18:19.306
Samuel…

00:18:24.603 --> 00:18:25.896
Ma'am Olivia.

00:18:44.915 --> 00:18:46.667
-Mia.
-Hello, Patrick.

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:49.253
Where are you?
What time are you coming home?

00:18:49.336 --> 00:18:50.963
I just stopped by the cemetery.

00:18:51.046 --> 00:18:53.006
Okay, come home straight away.

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:54.091
See you at home.

00:20:07.414 --> 00:20:10.125
"To my dearest Olivia.
Happy fourth anniversary, hon.

00:20:10.209 --> 00:20:12.920
I hope you're still happy with us…

00:20:13.003 --> 00:20:15.672
I feel like I'm in
heaven every time I'm with you.

00:20:15.756 --> 00:20:17.007
I can't wait to marry you…
…Have our own kids.

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:20.177
Just a little more patience, hon.

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:22.512
Because I…

00:20:22.596 --> 00:20:25.140
I can't wait to marry you. Samuel.

00:20:55.754 --> 00:20:58.006
Hey, wait a minute, Patrick.

00:20:58.090 --> 00:20:59.675
It's okay, Dipong.

00:21:01.551 --> 00:21:03.428
What do you want, Patrick?

00:21:04.805 --> 00:21:06.515
I found these.

00:21:06.598 --> 00:21:08.600
Letters from Mister Samuel.

00:21:12.145 --> 00:21:14.356
-I've long wondered if you're--
-Ingrid?

00:21:15.732 --> 00:21:18.694
You thought I was Mia's mother?

00:21:21.738 --> 00:21:23.156
I wish I were.

00:21:23.699 --> 00:21:26.285
Then I'd be Samuel's wife.

00:21:28.036 --> 00:21:29.913
How long have you known Samuel?

00:21:31.581 --> 00:21:33.166
I've known him since college.

00:21:34.626 --> 00:21:36.878
He was my first and only love.

00:21:37.546 --> 00:21:39.089
-Olivia!
-I came from

00:21:39.172 --> 00:21:40.674
-a poor family.
-I'm here!

00:21:40.757 --> 00:21:42.175
-The smell's making me hungry!
-But he accepted me

00:21:42.259 --> 00:21:44.553
-though I had nothing.
-Hmm! Delicious!

00:21:44.636 --> 00:21:45.929
What do you have there?

00:21:46.013 --> 00:21:47.264
A little something for you.

00:21:47.723 --> 00:21:49.766
And another special gift too.

00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:51.768
I know you're going to like it.

00:21:54.438 --> 00:21:56.690
How many more
poems are we going to read?

00:21:56.773 --> 00:21:59.443
I love
reading when I'm with you.

00:21:59.526 --> 00:22:01.069
"Each moment…

00:22:01.611 --> 00:22:03.572
the hours dim,

00:22:04.197 --> 00:22:06.158
yet hope lingers…"

00:22:06.241 --> 00:22:08.410
"…that our hearts…

00:22:08.493 --> 00:22:10.537
…will finally be as one."

00:22:11.621 --> 00:22:14.916
But Ingrid and
Samuel's marriage was arranged

00:22:15.459 --> 00:22:17.794
to save their estate.

00:22:17.878 --> 00:22:20.172
Ingrid comes from a wealthy family,

00:22:20.255 --> 00:22:22.507
so what chance did I have against her?

00:22:23.258 --> 00:22:24.426
It felt like…

00:22:26.344 --> 00:22:30.223
they stole the only man I ever loved.

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:33.977
After how many decades,

00:22:34.644 --> 00:22:36.229
I had searched for him.

00:22:39.066 --> 00:22:40.609
I found him.

00:22:41.818 --> 00:22:43.570
He's at OK Hospital.

00:22:44.988 --> 00:22:48.158
I learned about his condition,

00:22:48.241 --> 00:22:50.452
and I thought…

00:22:50.535 --> 00:22:51.620
I…

00:22:51.703 --> 00:22:54.289
I could care for him myself.

00:22:56.083 --> 00:22:58.293
To be the last person by his side

00:22:58.376 --> 00:23:00.921
until his final breath.

00:23:06.468 --> 00:23:09.012
But why didn't you tell
Mia about your connection?

00:23:13.683 --> 00:23:16.061
Because Ingrid will come back.

00:23:24.069 --> 00:23:26.780
I saw her rise
from the lake, Patrick.

00:23:26.863 --> 00:23:29.449
And this scar?

00:23:29.533 --> 00:23:30.742
She did this.

00:23:32.119 --> 00:23:33.328
I know she's alive.

00:23:33.662 --> 00:23:36.248
I don't know where she is,
but I know she's alive.

00:23:38.917 --> 00:23:42.671
I found out Dipong
was taking care of the mansion.

00:23:42.754 --> 00:23:44.381
So I hired him

00:23:45.006 --> 00:23:47.134
to keep an eye for Ingrid's return.

00:23:48.593 --> 00:23:52.222
I had him watch over Mia too.

00:23:53.181 --> 00:23:55.684
Who else would Ingrid be coming back for…

00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:58.645
…but her daughter?

00:24:00.438 --> 00:24:02.649
Ingrid is alive.

00:24:03.483 --> 00:24:05.443
And I'm also waiting for her return.

00:24:06.444 --> 00:24:09.906
I want to make
her pay for my mother's death.

00:24:12.701 --> 00:24:14.536
If you're not Ma'am Ingrid,

00:24:15.704 --> 00:24:17.122
then I have to go.

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:28.049
Mia!

00:24:29.342 --> 00:24:30.886
Mia?! Mia!

00:24:31.595 --> 00:24:32.721
Patrick?

00:24:32.804 --> 00:24:34.806
Mia?!

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:37.559
Mia, Olivia isn't your mother.

00:24:37.642 --> 00:24:40.270
So that means,
there's only one person who could be.

00:24:41.479 --> 00:24:42.689
Eden.

00:24:43.273 --> 00:24:44.441
Look at this.

00:24:44.524 --> 00:24:46.985
I found one of Eden's stories
at her house.

00:24:47.736 --> 00:24:49.237
You're also a writer.

00:24:49.321 --> 00:24:51.781
I'm sure you recognize
your mother's writing.

00:24:55.452 --> 00:24:56.995
What?

00:24:57.078 --> 00:24:58.413
She did it again.

00:24:58.496 --> 00:24:59.706
That's Mama's.

00:24:59.789 --> 00:25:01.124
Ma'am Eden's a writer?

00:25:01.791 --> 00:25:02.918
Yeah.

00:25:03.001 --> 00:25:04.044
It's kind of her hobby.

00:25:04.127 --> 00:25:06.796
It's her hobby to edit my works too.

00:25:09.966 --> 00:25:13.136
"For dawn brings many things along,

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:14.846
there's mystery,

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:16.223
death,

00:25:16.306 --> 00:25:18.225
and life reborn".

00:25:22.812 --> 00:25:25.190
I can hear my mother's voice.

00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:28.860
This is her writing style.

00:25:46.461 --> 00:25:48.213
Eden is my mother.

00:25:53.468 --> 00:25:58.431
Patrick, she's disliked
you since we were kids.

00:25:58.515 --> 00:26:01.601
Now that she's back,
I'm sure she'll try to harm you!

00:26:04.479 --> 00:26:06.523
"The servant
has vanished from the earth.

00:26:08.358 --> 00:26:12.112
A transformation, a life remade."

00:26:15.323 --> 00:26:17.033
She lived it for real.

00:26:18.618 --> 00:26:19.744
The words on her manuscript.

00:26:21.329 --> 00:26:22.539
You read it?

00:26:22.622 --> 00:26:24.916
Yes, I found it here.

00:26:27.585 --> 00:26:28.545
In here.

00:26:31.214 --> 00:26:34.676
I read something about transformation.

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:37.971
She must have taken
a new face to hide herself.

00:26:41.558 --> 00:26:42.976
Do you want to see it?

00:27:02.329 --> 00:27:04.497
I'm sure she did exactly that.

00:27:04.581 --> 00:27:08.335
To take advantage of it,
to get what she wants.

00:27:08.668 --> 00:27:10.378
I know her.

00:27:10.462 --> 00:27:13.590
That's why she wanted
Mister Samuel under her care.

00:27:14.215 --> 00:27:16.468
She wanted Papa under her control.

00:27:17.135 --> 00:27:18.720
That's why she came back

00:27:19.554 --> 00:27:21.514
to do the same to me.

00:27:29.939 --> 00:27:31.608
-Happy day!
-Happy day!

00:27:31.691 --> 00:27:34.652
I won't let her affect Matmat and me.

00:27:34.736 --> 00:27:36.196
What are you doing here?

00:27:36.279 --> 00:27:38.656
He's out of the hospital,
and you're still visiting him?

00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:40.116
They've found the body.

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:41.659
The killer's still unknown.

00:27:41.743 --> 00:27:44.788
"Useless children must
be thrown out to the sea."

00:27:44.871 --> 00:27:45.997
That's a threat, Mia.

00:27:46.081 --> 00:27:49.459
I won't let her ruin the life I have now.

00:27:49.542 --> 00:27:51.503
Matmat just got home.
