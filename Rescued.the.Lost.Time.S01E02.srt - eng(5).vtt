WEBVTT

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.920
Hey!

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.520
Father!

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.760
Hurry up!

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.840
Chang'an, here I come!

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.600
Go!

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:26.520
Hurry!

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.560
Those who collude with Tang forces will be executed.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.800
Those who flee from battle will be executed.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.680
Those who disobey military orders will be executed.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.610
Don't you see, the road to Chang'an

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.360
Ages us each time we return.

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:43.240
From now on, Chang'an is no longer home.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.160
Home bids farewell to Chang'an forever.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.680
Sir,

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.380
how is the divination?

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.610
Fire trigram. It indicates change

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.560
and good fortune from the west.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.890
This is a good sign, sir.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.960
There must be happy news coming.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.720
Report!

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.720
Sir!

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.600
Sir!

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.380
Official Li has returned.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.520
We caught the thief.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.079
It's not a thief.

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:37.880
It's a woman.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.400
A woman?

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.079
It hurts.

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:49.610
It hurts.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.760
What?

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.800
Now you know what pain feels like?

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.480
I have to tie you up like a criminal

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.410
so I can take you to see Master Chen.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.760
I said you could tie me up,

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.320
but I didn't say you could tie me this tight.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.480
If I don't tie you up tightly,

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.280
what if

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.060
you try to assassinate

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.720
Master Chen when you see him?

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:13.290
Let's go.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.000
Li Ling.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.680
I told you to catch a thief,

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.340
why did you bring back a woman?

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.840
This young lady's identity is suspicious.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.170
Blood stains were found at her residence.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:30.760
Madam,

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.850
I've been wrongfully accused!

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.040
I am a physician

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.600
who runs a clinic in Huaiyuan District.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.480
Patients come and go every day,

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.050
and some inevitably bleed from their wounds.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.360
There's a war outside the city.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.160
Those wounded soldiers

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.890
often come to me for treatment.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.440
It's unavoidable to have bloodstains inside and outside my place.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.120
I certainly haven't

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.120
done anything terrible!

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.680
[Pleading]

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.280
If you don't believe me,

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.560
you can investigate!

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.360
I truly am innocent.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.760
This Officer Li refused to believe me.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.840
He simply wouldn't listen.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.920
He used force

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.650
and brought me here tied up.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.240
I was frightened half to death!

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.720
Speak.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.120
What's your name?

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.160
Where are you from?

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.020
Tell the truth.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.880
My name is Nongyu,

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.300
I'm from Shanzhou.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.600
I've studied medicine since childhood

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.399
and traveled throughout the Western Regions.

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:23.460
I just arrived in Chang'an recently.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.740
From the west, huh?

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.640
You, a mere woman,

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.290
You really are a doctor.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.000
If you don't believe me, I can prove myself.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.780
The medicinal fragrance in this room...

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.400
has the scent of Chuanxiong and Zhuyu.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.200
These two herbs

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.330
are often used to treat headaches.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.240
I dare to guess

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.640
that you suffer from headaches.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.170
Do you experience insomnia and night sweats?

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.960
How did you know that?

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.760
This prescription may relieve headaches,

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.760
but it cannot cure the root cause.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:05.880
If used for too long,

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.140
it will harm your body.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:10.610
So you're saying

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.370
you have a better solution?

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.690
I dare to take your pulse, Sir Chen.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.730
Sir Chen,

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.570
you absolutely cannot!

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.360
This woman's background is unknown.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.320
It could be dangerous to let her get close.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.760
Officer Li, why would you say such things?

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.720
How could anyone dare to harm someone of Sir Chen's status?

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:29.520
I don't need to get close.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.640
I can still take your pulse from a distance.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:32.600
Is that true?

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.080
How extraordinary!

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.159
Years ago in the palace, I only saw once

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:59.300
when Master Yun diagnosed the Imperial Consort using suspended thread pulse-taking.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.120
I already understand your condition, sir.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.880
I'll prepare the medicine for you right away.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:07.640
Li Ling

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:08.380
is here.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.040
Assist me

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.640
and make no mistakes.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:13.360
Yes.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.610
Your medicine better work.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.820
Otherwise, in this Huaiyuan clinic,

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.280
there will be no more female doctor.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.400
Come take a look!

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.780
Take a look!

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:47.800
Li Ling is here.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.920
Are you two gentlemen here to buy medicine?

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.730
Is this pharmacy suitable?

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.560
It's arranged by Officer Li.

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.410
Please come in, gentlemen.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:12.530
Come.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.000
Quickly prepare the medicine according to this prescription.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:23.640
All right.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:24.440
Waiter!

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.280
Bring tea for our guests quickly!

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.200
Right away!

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.320
Your tea, sir.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:38.040
Sir,

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.040
there are two sets of medicine on this prescription.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.240
I need to go to the back

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.440
to fetch them.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.040
Your medicine isn't fake, is it?

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:51.720
If you don't trust me,

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.440
you can follow me to the back room

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.080
and inspect it yourself.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:56.680
Very well.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.160
Wait a moment.

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:06.760
This is your young friend's prescription.

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.000
Since we're already here,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.460
let's get this filled too.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:13.760
Don't worry.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.260
As long as I keep quiet,

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.040
no one will know.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.500
Officer Li, you're using public resources for personal gain.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.000
Excellent tea!

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.780
No wonder you're in Master Chen's favor.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.320
I'm like someone walking at night with a bald man,

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.179
benefiting from the reflection.

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:42.970
What did you say?

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.330
A-Qi is with her?

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.130
How did this happen?

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.280
The city gates are all sealed now.

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.240
The streets are full of secret guards.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.680
And A-Qi urgently needs treatment.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.800
Even if we wanted to move, we couldn't.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.400
What exactly does she want to do?

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:58.260
She didn't say.

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:01.160
She only mentioned going into the Chen residence.

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.160
Is it ready, Officer Li?

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.400
The medicine is ready.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.480
I need to take it back to the pharmacy to brew it.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.520
After it's brewed, I'll have to deliver it again.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:12.250
Mr. Chen's medicine cannot be taken carelessly.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.770
Could it be Chen Jingbian's enemy?

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.560
Using medicine as an excuse to kill him?

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.840
We haven't obtained the Night Firefly Map yet.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.440
Chen Jingbian absolutely cannot come to harm.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.180
I know that, of course.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.240
But for now,

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.520
we can only take it one step at a time.

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:30.000
All right.

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:31.080
Come.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:32.880
Take care.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:46.840
Let me.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:50.680
I'll do it.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.080
It's so bitter!

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.040
What did you give him?

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.040
Five-Poison Death Pill.

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:04.200
You...

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.240
It's sugar-preserved plum.

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:08.360
It's so sweet.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.680
Thank you, Sister Yu.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:11.360
No need to thank me.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.860
Tell that Ling of yours

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.480
to stop glaring at me.

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:17.800
Let's go.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.460
I need to deliver medicine to Mr. Chen later.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.740
You should rest first.

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:26.600
Sweet.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:33.700
Master.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.600
Dr. Yu's medicine is ready.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:56.880
I've tested it with a silver needle.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:57.940
It's not poisoned.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.080
Tell me the truth.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.220
Did you tamper with the medicine?

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:18.740
Master!

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.220
What's wrong, Master?
