WEBVTT

00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:04.796
The butterflies who
killed Mama are after Matmat!

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:06.423
I know that butterfly.

00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:07.924
Nurse Olivia,

00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:11.469
did she paint
that butterfly on Matmat's mural?!

00:00:11.553 --> 00:00:13.179
Go away!

00:00:13.263 --> 00:00:14.681
Mia, we're not
leaving each other, remember?

00:00:14.764 --> 00:00:16.891
I can't keep that promise anymore.

00:00:16.975 --> 00:00:19.519
Matmat, I'm so sorry.

00:00:19.602 --> 00:00:23.273
Matmat accepts your apology.

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:26.067
What happened to Mia?
She doesn't want to finish their book.

00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:27.694
Mia, where are you going?

00:00:27.777 --> 00:00:28.820
Mia!

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:41.893
Mia?!

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.313
Mia!

00:02:15.552 --> 00:02:19.556
"THE BIG 'AHHH' OF DALAGITA"

00:02:23.226 --> 00:02:25.395
-Please let us in.
-We just want a photo.

00:02:25.478 --> 00:02:27.147
-Just one picture.
-Please, sir.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.857
-Come on, sir. Please!
-Sir, please!

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.025
Sorry, you can't go in.

00:02:51.921 --> 00:02:54.340
-Hello! Hello, Mia?!
-Stop calling me.

00:02:54.424 --> 00:02:56.009
Wait! Don't hang up.

00:02:56.092 --> 00:02:58.678
Don't hang up.
I just want to talk to you personally.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.725
Mia, I know you're going through
something you don't want to share with me.

00:03:03.808 --> 00:03:05.602
Fine, fine. I respect that.

00:03:06.227 --> 00:03:07.854
You don't want
to write for my publishing house,

00:03:07.937 --> 00:03:08.938
sure!

00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:10.064
I support you.

00:03:10.607 --> 00:03:12.525
But Mia, please, let's meet.

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:13.526
No.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:14.777
Mia, please.

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:17.947
I'm begging you. Let's meet.

00:03:18.573 --> 00:03:19.699
I'm here in Manila--

00:03:19.782 --> 00:03:21.242
And I know you!

00:03:21.326 --> 00:03:22.368
You're here as well.

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:25.663
Please, Mia, just meet me. One last time.

00:03:25.747 --> 00:03:27.248
Hello? Hello--

00:03:33.755 --> 00:03:37.091
"Dalagita was
born into a wealthy family.

00:03:38.092 --> 00:03:40.678
Her beauty was flawless and unmatched.

00:03:41.554 --> 00:03:44.682
That's why her mother
promised to give her everything.

00:03:45.266 --> 00:03:49.145
Even the sun, the moon and the stars.

00:03:49.854 --> 00:03:52.690
Dalagita's mother squealed with joy"

00:03:52.774 --> 00:03:55.276
"when she learned
her daughter had started to eat.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.152
Ahhh.

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:59.781
"I'll feed you
whatever you want, Dalagita."

00:03:59.864 --> 00:04:03.243
"Just open your mouth
as wide as you can."

00:04:04.744 --> 00:04:06.621
Her mother was overjoyed again

00:04:06.704 --> 00:04:09.123
when she learned
Dalagita would soon walk.

00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:12.335
She immediately came close and said…

00:04:12.418 --> 00:04:14.712
"Climb on my back, Dalagita."

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:16.756
"I'll carry you."

00:04:18.508 --> 00:04:21.844
"After giving Dalagita
everything she needed,

00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:23.388
there came a time

00:04:23.471 --> 00:04:26.182
when it was
the mother who made a request.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.602
"Dalagita, I'm tired today."

00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:32.730
"Can you get me
something to eat and drink?"

00:04:32.814 --> 00:04:34.649
Dalagita replied.

00:04:34.732 --> 00:04:37.110
"Mama, I don't have hands."

00:04:37.193 --> 00:04:39.570
"You always gave everything to me."

00:04:39.654 --> 00:04:41.906
"I never used them,

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.367
so eventually, my hands disappeared."

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:48.288
Her weary mother made another request.

00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:50.873
She wanted to be
carried because her legs hurt.

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.543
But Dalagita said…

00:04:53.626 --> 00:04:55.586
"Mama, I don't have feet."

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:59.340
"You always carried me, so I
never learned to walk on the ground."

00:04:59.424 --> 00:05:01.175
"But I do have a big mouth."

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.553
"Can you see it?"

00:05:03.636 --> 00:05:04.929
"Ahhh!"

00:05:05.013 --> 00:05:08.308
That came from
her mouth as she opened it wide.

00:05:09.017 --> 00:05:11.269
Dalagita's mother screamed in anger.

00:05:11.352 --> 00:05:14.022
"You're a useless child!"

00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:16.482
"Like a fish deep in the sea,

00:05:16.566 --> 00:05:20.445
you can't do anything
but drink the salty water."

00:05:21.612 --> 00:05:24.490
"Without mercy,
she threw Dalagita into the sea.

00:05:24.574 --> 00:05:27.577
Her mother didn't care
what might happen to her.

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.080
Time passed and the present came.

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:33.875
The fishermen
who sailed had stories to tell.

00:05:34.625 --> 00:05:37.128
Whenever the strong
winds lashed against the sea,

00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:40.048
they heard a loud cry".

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.343
"Echoing".

00:05:44.427 --> 00:05:49.599
"Chilling. Like the cry of
a child with a broken heart".

00:05:49.682 --> 00:05:51.684
"Mama…"

00:05:51.768 --> 00:05:53.728
"Mama, come back for me."

00:05:54.395 --> 00:05:56.105
"What did I do wrong?"

00:05:57.315 --> 00:05:59.901
"Watch again what my mouth can do."

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.237
"Ahhh… Ahhh…"

00:06:06.491 --> 00:06:08.951
"Mama… Mama…"

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:10.787
"Mama, where are you?"

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.664
"Come back and take me with you."

00:06:20.588 --> 00:06:23.341
"This is my favorite of all your books.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.718
But just like Dalagita,

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:28.930
useless children like you…

00:06:29.847 --> 00:06:31.766
deserve to be thrown into the sea."

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.144
It's Ingrid.

00:06:37.313 --> 00:06:38.856
Ingrid wrote this.

00:06:44.987 --> 00:06:46.364
Pretty love…

00:06:46.447 --> 00:06:51.244
I know your job is stressful,
so I bought you a cake.

00:06:51.327 --> 00:06:52.411
That's how it is!

00:06:52.495 --> 00:06:54.038
Come on! Why are you here?

00:06:54.122 --> 00:06:56.874
Didn't I tell you not to come here?

00:06:56.958 --> 00:07:00.753
We can just meet some
other time or another day.

00:07:00.837 --> 00:07:03.798
Didn't I tell you to
leave that Vincent already?!

00:07:03.881 --> 00:07:06.509
Just go work in a factory in Taiwan.

00:07:06.592 --> 00:07:08.803
I don't want that.

00:07:09.428 --> 00:07:12.974
We agreed that as
long as I gave you money,

00:07:13.057 --> 00:07:14.183
you'd leave me alone.

00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:17.437
But I don't get
anything out of Vincent anymore!

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.105
Here's what you should do.

00:07:19.188 --> 00:07:22.692
Steal one of his watches and pawn it.

00:07:22.775 --> 00:07:23.901
Or steal from Mia.

00:07:23.985 --> 00:07:25.903
She's got expensive stuff, right?

00:07:26.487 --> 00:07:28.448
I'm not a thief.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.076
You're really useless, you know that?!

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.203
Mama should've given you up for adoption!

00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:35.246
Damn you!

00:07:35.329 --> 00:07:36.706
Hey!

00:07:36.789 --> 00:07:39.000
How could
you hit your own sister?!

00:07:39.083 --> 00:07:41.169
-Stay behind me.
-Who's this bastard, Madeth?!

00:07:41.252 --> 00:07:42.420
You're the one who's a bastard!

00:07:42.503 --> 00:07:44.505
You've got a big
body but won't even work!

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:47.133
You're still leeching
off someone half your size!

00:07:47.216 --> 00:07:48.301
Bro!

00:07:48.384 --> 00:07:49.802
Jason, enough.

00:07:49.886 --> 00:07:51.554
Bro, please, no…

00:07:51.637 --> 00:07:54.140
Never come back here!
Don't show your face again!

00:07:54.223 --> 00:07:55.349
-Bro…
-Don't ever come back!

00:07:55.433 --> 00:07:57.518
-Bro, just leave.
-I'm warning you!

00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:00.771
Don't you dare come back here again!

00:08:08.738 --> 00:08:09.947
Hey…

00:08:10.031 --> 00:08:11.365
Come over here.

00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:13.367
Are you okay?

00:08:16.078 --> 00:08:19.749
Why did you interfere? Now you're hurt.

00:08:20.541 --> 00:08:22.835
Your brother was hurting you, Madeth.

00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:24.462
Was I supposed to do nothing?

00:08:25.338 --> 00:08:26.714
I can handle it.

00:08:27.423 --> 00:08:29.926
Because what?
You're a strong, independent woman?

00:08:30.801 --> 00:08:33.137
Madeth, your brother is abusing you.

00:08:36.933 --> 00:08:38.017
Hey!

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.603
Look at you!
You're crying now, it's over.

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:42.313
Oh my!

00:08:43.898 --> 00:08:44.899
Look at me.

00:08:46.108 --> 00:08:47.360
Don't cry.

00:08:50.154 --> 00:08:52.114
I'm okay.

00:08:52.198 --> 00:08:54.909
This is the first time
I've experienced this.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.121
Someone defending me.

00:09:01.332 --> 00:09:02.333
Madeth.

00:09:03.084 --> 00:09:04.752
Of course I'll defend you.

00:09:06.921 --> 00:09:08.339
You're important to me.

00:09:24.021 --> 00:09:25.773
Um…

00:09:27.108 --> 00:09:28.734
Um, uh…

00:09:28.818 --> 00:09:31.946
Hello? Boss V?

00:09:35.324 --> 00:09:37.618
Huh? Boss V, right now?

00:09:38.536 --> 00:09:39.912
As in right now?

00:09:41.706 --> 00:09:43.291
That's so you'll finally leave me alone.

00:09:46.836 --> 00:09:47.962
What is this?

00:09:48.504 --> 00:09:51.257
I know you'll keep trying
to convince me to change my mind.

00:09:51.674 --> 00:09:54.051
"THE SHADOWS BEHIND A NEW FACE"

00:10:10.735 --> 00:10:13.237
I know how important this is to you, Mia.

00:10:14.614 --> 00:10:17.533
And so many people are
waiting for the last installment.

00:10:18.743 --> 00:10:21.162
I've been trying to get
this from you for a long time.

00:10:24.206 --> 00:10:26.000
But you're more important to me.

00:10:29.378 --> 00:10:34.300
That's why I'd rather
publish your book than this.

00:10:38.095 --> 00:10:39.096
You don't want this?

00:10:42.516 --> 00:10:43.517
I don't want that.

00:10:45.436 --> 00:10:46.479
Okay.

00:10:47.855 --> 00:10:48.981
O-Okay?--Hey!

00:10:49.065 --> 00:10:50.650
Hey, wait! Where are you going?

00:10:51.442 --> 00:10:54.612
Didn't you say you just
wanted to meet one last time?

00:10:54.695 --> 00:10:55.738
Yeah?

00:10:55.821 --> 00:10:57.365
Well, we've met.

00:10:57.448 --> 00:10:59.241
-I'll be going.
-Hey!

00:11:00.034 --> 00:11:02.703
Mia, wait! We're not done talking. Hey!

00:11:13.381 --> 00:11:14.757
-Miss, the bill.
-Yes, sir?

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:16.050
-Give me our bill.
-Okay, sir.

00:11:16.133 --> 00:11:17.927
Please, make it quick.

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:22.348
Hey!

00:11:22.431 --> 00:11:24.266
Excuse me, sir. Here's your bill.

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:26.268
-Keep the change.
-Thank you, sir.

00:11:26.352 --> 00:11:27.895
Uh, wait! Wait! Mister! Mister!

00:11:27.978 --> 00:11:30.231
Wait! Hold on! Hey, mister! Mister!

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:47.790
You and Vincent ganged up on me.

00:11:51.794 --> 00:11:53.629
Don't you understand?

00:11:53.712 --> 00:11:56.757
When I drove you out of the house,
what I meant was…

00:11:57.466 --> 00:11:59.009
-I didn't want--
-I forgive you.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.974
If you think it's a sin
being the child of the person

00:12:05.057 --> 00:12:06.600
who killed my mother…

00:12:08.811 --> 00:12:10.438
I've already forgiven you.

00:12:12.815 --> 00:12:14.233
If my forgiveness is what it takes

00:12:14.316 --> 00:12:15.860
to bring you back to us…

00:12:18.446 --> 00:12:20.489
I'll forgive you over and over again.

00:12:28.789 --> 00:12:30.291
Patrick…

00:12:31.459 --> 00:12:33.377
Mia, we shouldn't be torn apart

00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:36.088
for a sin we didn't even commit.

00:12:38.382 --> 00:12:39.675
I'm sorry…

00:12:49.268 --> 00:12:50.394
I'm so--

00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:55.024
I'm so, so sorry.

00:13:16.212 --> 00:13:17.421
Are we okay now?

00:13:52.915 --> 00:13:53.958
Madeth!

00:13:54.583 --> 00:13:55.709
Hey, Madeth!

00:13:58.754 --> 00:14:00.297
Where are you, Madeth?

00:14:06.679 --> 00:14:07.680
Madeth!

00:14:10.808 --> 00:14:12.560
My goodness, Boss V!

00:14:13.394 --> 00:14:18.232
Did you really have to make
me come back to Manila for this?

00:14:19.441 --> 00:14:21.735
Can you please stop complaining?

00:14:21.819 --> 00:14:24.488
Just keep looking for
Mia's mother's manuscript.

00:14:24.572 --> 00:14:26.866
Once we find it, we can publish it.

00:14:28.367 --> 00:14:30.703
Huh? Boss V,

00:14:30.786 --> 00:14:34.290
Isn't that like deceiving Miss Mia?

00:14:34.748 --> 00:14:36.542
Madeth, use your brain.

00:14:36.625 --> 00:14:38.752
We're not. It's called insurance.

00:14:38.836 --> 00:14:40.671
What if Mia doesn't
finish writing her book?

00:14:40.754 --> 00:14:42.381
The manuscript will be our backup.

00:14:42.464 --> 00:14:48.345
Boss V, this backup of yours
has gotten us walking on trash.

00:14:48.429 --> 00:14:50.139
I can't even see it.

00:14:51.807 --> 00:14:54.768
Let's take a break, Boss V.
This is exhausting.

00:14:54.852 --> 00:14:56.145
We can't take a break!

00:14:56.228 --> 00:14:58.272
What if the garbage
collectors come and find it?

00:14:58.355 --> 00:15:00.691
It's us who should be profiting from it.

00:15:02.318 --> 00:15:03.736
Oh, I get it.

00:15:04.445 --> 00:15:06.906
Money! You only care about money!

00:15:06.989 --> 00:15:08.699
I'm out of here! It's always about money!

00:15:08.782 --> 00:15:10.868
-I thought you've changed!
-Hey!

00:15:10.951 --> 00:15:12.494
-Hey, hey!
-You'll always be greedy!

00:15:12.578 --> 00:15:14.580
-Hey, hey, where are you going?
-I'm leaving!

00:15:14.663 --> 00:15:18.042
Swimming in trash
isn't in my job description!

00:15:18.125 --> 00:15:19.460
-No thank you!
-Hey, Madeth!

00:15:19.543 --> 00:15:22.546
If I find the manuscript,
you won't get a bonus from me!

00:15:23.005 --> 00:15:24.006
Fine!

00:15:35.059 --> 00:15:36.727
You're so mean, Boss V.

00:15:37.853 --> 00:15:40.689
You can go crazy
looking through the trash.

00:15:40.773 --> 00:15:44.109
I'm not showing this
to you until you act nice to me.

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:46.195
I'll get back at you for this.

00:15:58.707 --> 00:16:03.003
You think either Olivia
or Eden could be my mom?

00:16:03.504 --> 00:16:06.090
They're the ones
who fit Zelda's description.

00:16:06.173 --> 00:16:08.926
Plus, the way
they act towards Mister Samuel,

00:16:09.009 --> 00:16:11.845
and that book
that was left at the mansion.

00:16:12.554 --> 00:16:14.556
They're a threat to your life.

00:16:16.475 --> 00:16:19.061
I'm used to my mom hurting me.

00:16:19.853 --> 00:16:21.939
But if she plans on hurting Matmat,

00:16:22.481 --> 00:16:24.274
I will not let that happen.

00:16:24.358 --> 00:16:26.694
-But, Mia--
-Let's confront them.

00:16:28.112 --> 00:16:29.905
We can take them both on.

00:16:31.031 --> 00:16:34.076
I'm not afraid
because I have my safety pin.

00:16:35.536 --> 00:16:36.787
I have you.

00:16:51.802 --> 00:16:53.595
-Patrick, Mia!
-Vincent?

00:16:54.221 --> 00:16:55.514
It was a success!

00:16:56.015 --> 00:16:57.808
I assume it is because you're together.

00:16:57.891 --> 00:17:00.227
That stench! Stay there!

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:02.479
-Don't come near us.
-Why? Why?

00:17:02.563 --> 00:17:03.689
You stink.

00:17:06.525 --> 00:17:07.735
Where's Madeth?

00:17:07.818 --> 00:17:10.487
Forget about Madeth!
What matters is Mia's here!

00:17:10.571 --> 00:17:12.448
I'm so happy. Can I give you a hug?

00:17:12.531 --> 00:17:14.533
-No, stay away, stay away!
-It's okay.

00:17:14.616 --> 00:17:16.493
-Stay away.
-Here's good?

00:17:16.577 --> 00:17:17.870
-Yes.
-Okay.

00:17:18.495 --> 00:17:20.622
Vincent…Okay, fine.

00:17:21.081 --> 00:17:22.541
I'll work on the book.

00:17:22.624 --> 00:17:24.293
Matmat and I will finish it.

00:17:24.376 --> 00:17:26.253
But, please…

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:27.713
Take a bath.

00:17:28.088 --> 00:17:29.339
Yes, yes!

00:17:30.799 --> 00:17:33.927
Yes, I'll do whatever you want.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.430
I'll take a shower now! Yes!

00:17:39.308 --> 00:17:41.143
Take care. Drive safely, Patrick.

00:17:41.226 --> 00:17:42.311
Be careful.

00:17:49.777 --> 00:17:51.445
Eden has a son?

00:17:51.904 --> 00:17:53.781
And you're telling me he turned out fine?

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:57.493
Then she's
definitely not my mother.

00:17:57.576 --> 00:17:58.911
How can you be sure?

00:17:58.994 --> 00:18:02.831
Because my mother is
a never ending black hole of selfishness.

00:18:02.915 --> 00:18:05.667
If she wasn't able to take care of me,

00:18:05.751 --> 00:18:07.586
how would she take care of someone else?

00:18:08.712 --> 00:18:09.880
Mia?

00:18:10.422 --> 00:18:11.799
Patpat?

00:18:16.887 --> 00:18:19.348
You're home late. How was the trip?

00:18:21.016 --> 00:18:24.061
Did you two make up?
D-Did you kiss each other?

00:18:24.144 --> 00:18:25.312
Matmat!

00:18:25.729 --> 00:18:27.940
As long as
they've made up, that's fine.

00:18:28.023 --> 00:18:30.651
Uh, you two should eat dinner.
I've already prepared some food.

00:18:40.327 --> 00:18:43.205
You left before everyone finished eating.

00:18:45.374 --> 00:18:46.959
I know, I'm sorry.

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:51.296
I know Vincent had multiple showers but,

00:18:52.339 --> 00:18:55.551
I still couldn't stand his smell,
so I stepped out.

00:19:04.101 --> 00:19:05.853
Are you ready to face them?

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:13.902
Both Ma'am Olivia and Ma'am Eden?

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:19.950
-What will we do if--
-Can we not talk about it now?

00:19:23.787 --> 00:19:25.622
A lot has happened.

00:19:30.627 --> 00:19:32.588
I just want to have a moment of peace…

00:19:33.964 --> 00:19:36.675
before I deal with
the things I need to face.

00:19:38.302 --> 00:19:39.553
Just for tonight.

00:20:10.792 --> 00:20:14.838
Matmat already set up the bed.

00:20:14.922 --> 00:20:17.007
Miss Mia can sleep here.

00:20:26.892 --> 00:20:28.810
-Thanks, Matmat.
-Shh!

00:20:28.894 --> 00:20:31.271
-M-Mia's sleeping.
-Oh.

00:20:31.355 --> 00:20:33.190
Keep your voice down.

00:20:42.908 --> 00:20:45.535
G-Good night, Patpat.

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:47.621
Good night, Matmat.

00:21:06.139 --> 00:21:07.266
Good night, Mia.

00:21:17.317 --> 00:21:19.027
She's not here, Patrick.

00:21:19.111 --> 00:21:21.321
Eden hasn't come to work for a while now.

00:21:24.199 --> 00:21:26.618
She's gone AWOL. We couldn't contact her.

00:21:27.327 --> 00:21:30.247
She's been working here for so long,
but Eden has never done this before.

00:21:31.581 --> 00:21:33.375
When did she stop coming to work?

00:21:34.584 --> 00:21:38.588
Ever since we found
that butterfly on Matmat's painting.

00:21:44.469 --> 00:21:47.556
The butterfly appeared
after Mister Samuel's death.

00:21:49.266 --> 00:21:51.059
It's no coincidence.

00:21:51.643 --> 00:21:53.103
She has something to do with this.

00:22:02.362 --> 00:22:04.072
She just suddenly left.

00:22:05.449 --> 00:22:07.367
She left without telling anyone?

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:11.621
She took some
of her belongings with her.

00:22:11.705 --> 00:22:14.249
She told me not to follow her because

00:22:15.208 --> 00:22:17.586
I know that I'm not her real son.

00:22:24.134 --> 00:22:25.969
Now that explains everything.

00:22:27.095 --> 00:22:30.140
Do you know where she might go?
Did she say anything to you?

00:22:30.682 --> 00:22:31.975
Somewhere we
might be able to find her?

00:22:32.059 --> 00:22:34.227
No.

00:22:35.145 --> 00:22:36.521
Mama left me.

00:22:41.401 --> 00:22:43.153
Where the hell is she?

00:22:44.863 --> 00:22:46.323
She's hiding.

00:22:46.406 --> 00:22:48.950
She knows we're onto her,
so she went into hiding.

00:22:53.413 --> 00:22:54.414
Stay there.

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:56.541
Patrick!

00:23:07.177 --> 00:23:08.345
Mia, stay right there.

00:23:16.311 --> 00:23:17.270
Stay there.

00:23:54.766 --> 00:23:55.767
Mia!

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:00.856
She's making her presence felt.

00:24:03.108 --> 00:24:04.442
You need to get out of here, Mia.

00:24:04.526 --> 00:24:06.319
I'm not afraid of her.

00:24:07.028 --> 00:24:09.781
And all this time,
she's been working with Mister Dipong.

00:24:09.865 --> 00:24:11.741
He's the only one
with access to the house,

00:24:11.825 --> 00:24:13.368
so I'm sure he did this.

00:24:13.451 --> 00:24:15.412
We can't be sure, Mia.

00:24:15.495 --> 00:24:18.039
Your mom might be
the one behind all of this.

00:24:20.208 --> 00:24:22.085
But if Mister Dipong
had something to do with this,

00:24:22.794 --> 00:24:24.296
we need to find him.

00:24:33.013 --> 00:24:34.097
We're here.

00:24:34.848 --> 00:24:37.893
Thank you for taking
me to Mister Dipong's house.

00:24:37.976 --> 00:24:38.977
I'll take it from here.

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:40.562
Alright, we'll get going.

00:24:40.645 --> 00:24:41.646
Thank you.

00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:51.698
Mister Dipong?

00:25:37.619 --> 00:25:39.746
Mister Dipong was
the one who took Mister Samuel?

00:25:40.789 --> 00:25:42.457
He was working with Ma'am Olivia?

00:25:53.301 --> 00:25:54.678
We'll face the butterfly together.

00:25:54.761 --> 00:25:56.346
The woman was wearing that!

00:25:56.429 --> 00:25:58.932
You've known for a long time.
Was she your mother's killer?

00:25:59.015 --> 00:26:01.184
The butterfly appeared
after Mister Samuel's death.

00:26:01.268 --> 00:26:04.771
You think either Olivia
or Eden could be my mom?

00:26:04.854 --> 00:26:06.856
Eden left her son all alone.

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:10.193
All evidence points
to Miss Olivia being your mother.

00:26:10.277 --> 00:26:11.903
How can we uncover their identity?

00:26:11.987 --> 00:26:13.863
Mia and I finished our book.

00:26:13.947 --> 00:26:15.740
Welcome, everyone.

00:26:15.824 --> 00:26:17.701
You want everyone to see this?

00:26:17.784 --> 00:26:18.910
I want them to come out

00:26:18.994 --> 00:26:21.538
so I can confront them,
and find out who my mom is.

00:26:21.621 --> 00:26:23.665
I need to protect you and Matmat.

00:26:23.748 --> 00:26:27.377
As long as we're all together,
we can face anything, right?

00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:30.255
Useless children
should be thrown out to the sea.

00:26:30.338 --> 00:26:31.464
That's a threat, Mia.

00:26:31.548 --> 00:26:33.758
-Your life is in danger.
-I'm not afraid of her!

00:26:33.842 --> 00:26:36.219
We're not ganging up on you!
We're trying to protect you!

00:26:36.303 --> 00:26:39.556
I won't let you ruin the life I have now.

00:26:39.639 --> 00:26:43.226
Matmat doesn't like
people doing bad things.

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:45.562
No matter what happens,
don't go with them.

00:26:45.645 --> 00:26:48.523
Now that she's here, she'll hurt you too!

00:26:48.606 --> 00:26:50.400
B-Butterfly!

00:26:50.483 --> 00:26:52.110
You'll pay for everything you've done.

00:26:52.193 --> 00:26:55.905
I'd rather die than end up like you.

00:26:55.989 --> 00:26:57.157
Mia!
