00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.070
This family

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.270
really have a lot of sly ideas.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:53.620
Your Highness,

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.740
Mr. Lin has already gone
to look for them.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.340
What should we plan to do?

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:58.740
Not eating?

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.300
Shame on you!

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.660
Send someone to pursue immediately.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.440
Make sure to bring the Shen family back

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.900
before him.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.860
Yes.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.420
For the sake of this family,

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.460
Lin Yan actually disregarded his dignity

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.660
to come to me and ask for them.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.580
They are far more influential

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.300
than I imagined.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.580
But this family is so cunning.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.380
They actually managed to escape.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.590
Otherwise, we would have pried the truth
out of them.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.980
Rather than using the Shen family
to manipulate Lin Yan,

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.100
there is actually a simpler method.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.460
Go ahead.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.090
Get rid of him.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.100
I know

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.660
you've raised him for many years

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.700
and cannot bear to do it.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.340
But raising a tiger invites disaster.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.370
We'll talk about it later.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:14.660
Run quickly!

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:15.620
Run!

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:20.730
Yangyang.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:21.700
Yangyang.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.100
Are you OK, Yangyang?

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.940
Get up quickly.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:25.900
What's wrong with you?

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.660
Can't you walk carefully?

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.020
If my baby gets injured,

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.260
I won't let this go with you.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.100
My fault. My fault.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.620
Yangyang, did you get injured?

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.060
We've been running for a long time.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.520
And this road is hard for both people
and horses to travel.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.060
How about we take a break?

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.760
They won't be able to catch up
for a while.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:41.500
Take a break.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.030
I really can't run anymore.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.260
Have a break.
They don't catch up.

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:46.130
Let me check on you.

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.020
Are you OK?

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.060
Did you hurt yourself?

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.260
I'm sorry, Yangyang, I'm sorry.

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.180
Be careful, Jicai.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.100
We found the fruit!

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.620
Auntie, grandma,

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.420
do you think this grass is edible?

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:00.820
Let me go over and take a look.

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.940
Father.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:03.610
OK.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:04.860
Let me take a look.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.220
Look at this.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.590
- What did you pick, Yangyang?
- Shaojie.

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:08.700
Get up and work.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.220
Why are you always lying here?

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:11.780
What's it?

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:15.460
Jicai, look.

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:17.780
Yangyang, where did you pick this?

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:18.940
Right in here.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.060
Look, there's plenty of them.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.540
This... this seems to be smartweed.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:25.780
Is it spicy?

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.340
What is it? Is it edible?

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.620
We have to taste it.

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:29.460
If it is smartweed,

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:30.460
then it is edible.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.180
But then, who will taste it?

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.780
Do we have to learn from Shennong
and taste all kinds of herbs?

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.550
Yangyang, you even know
how to use allusions.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:37.820
Better than your father.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:40.890
You found something to eat?

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:42.460
What's this?

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.020
Father, why did you eat it?

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.500
- Gongcai...
- Father!

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.090
Father!

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.060
- Father!
- Gongcai!

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.900
Gongcai, come on.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:54.950
Spit it out! Hurry up.

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:56.500
- Hurry up.
- Spit it out.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.940
Spit it out.

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.980
- Come on.
- Father,

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.360
- Spit it out.
- Spit, spit, spit.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.860
- Father...
- Spit it out.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.060
Spit, spit.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.900
Alright, alright.

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:05.380
Alright.

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:06.780
Did you spit it out?

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.700
Father, you're choking me to death.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.180
- Feel better?
- It's fine.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.220
This thing

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:14.460
is so spicy.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.140
- It's spicy?
- It's spicy.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.340
It means that it is edible.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.540
Then we can cook spicy dishes.

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:21.660
Hot and sour noodles.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:23.940
Boiled fish in spicy soup.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.460
Mapo tofu.

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.460
Spicy chicken cubes.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.020
Spicy boiled blood curd.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.940
Auntie,

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.740
can we bring back more smartweed?

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:36.900
I want to eat spicy strips.

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:39.540
Yangyang, you want to eat,

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:40.940
why not let me make it for you?

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.020
You definitely don't know
how to make it.

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:44.660
Don't worry.

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.980
I just dug up several plants
of smartweed.

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.360
Maybe I can even set up
a special section for spicy dishes.

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:51.740
Spicy chicken, spicy fried duck,
Mapo tofu.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.040
Much more useful than the dogwood
they like to use here.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.510
That's why we still have
to be in the human world;

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:57.560
hell won't do,

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.950
we can't even get spicy food there.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.060
The last one.
You all aren't eating it, huh?

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.160
If you don't, I'll take it.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.300
Father, I want it too.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:05.100
Yangyang,

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.660
let's play rock-paper-scissors.

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:07.650
Whoever wins gets to eat.

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:08.660
I'll count to three.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:09.900
I'll play paper, OK?

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.220
Come on, one,

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:12.190
two,

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.100
three.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.140
I win!

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.280
- Shen Shaojie, you cheat?
- Shen Gongcai.

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:18.140
You naughty boy!

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:19.180
Just for something to eat,

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:20.580
you even lied to your own daughter.

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.180
Mother, how come you don't know
how to joke either?

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.300
I'm just teasing her.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.000
She can't even trust her own father.

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:27.100
When she grows up, she won't

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.620
be deceived by another man, right?

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:29.460
Well,

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:30.740
you're always in the right.

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:32.440
Yangyang, don't be angry.
I'm kidding.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:33.380
Let me take it for you.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:39.300
Grandma.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:40.300
Don't move.

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:41.460
Don't... don't move.

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.300
You're hiding here.

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:44.700
We finally found you.

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:45.750
Did they put

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:46.710
a tracking system on us?

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:47.660
They actually found us.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:49.300
Stop that. Take Yangyang away quickly.

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:50.780
Yes, Jicai,

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:51.860
you go with Yangyang.

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:53.980
I want to let them know

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.700
what it means to be a heroine.

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:57.900
Mother, can you handle this?

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:58.980
You don't understand her.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:06:59.990
She is absolutely capable.

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:01.160
When I was young,

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:02.290
I trained in discus throwing.

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.020
Hear that? This is why it hurts so much

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:05.260
every time she pinches me.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.660
You've got quite some guts,
even started chatting.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.100
Jicai, hurry up and go.

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:10.140
Hurry, take Yangyang away.

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.860
Let's go!

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:11.860
Catch them!

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:40.460
Yangyang.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:42.100
I really can't run anymore.

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:46.580
Go, quickly.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:54.600
Auntie.

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:55.480
Here.

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:56.340
Come. Quick.

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:57.540
Here, hide inside.

00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:58.980
OK. Auntie, you come in too.

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:00.980
Auntie.

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:02.180
You can't get away.

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:10.140
Yangyang, just hide here.

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:10.980
Don't make a sound.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.950
I'll make spicy strips for you
after I come back.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:14.720
Don't make a sound.

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:15.990
Auntie...

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:20.220
You little brat, come here.

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:21.220
Come catch me.

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:32.780
Weren't you acting tough just now?

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.420
Discus throwing or something.

00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:36.270
Let me...

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:37.580
What are you doing?

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:39.750
Father!

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:40.660
Fengxia.

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:46.020
Jianshe...

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:48.380
You're courting death.

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:01.700
You're the ones courting death.

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:02.880
- Mr. Lin.
- Are you alright?

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:04.820
Take this message back.

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:06.780
If you lay a hand
on the Shen family again,

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:08.980
I will never let it slide.

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:10.500
Let's go.

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:11.740
Get lost.

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:13.140
Just wait and see.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.460
- Mr. Lin.
- Where are Jicai and Yangyang?

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:16.900
They ran in that direction.

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:18.500
Let's go.

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:19.640
- Go.
- Go.

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:20.780
Take care.

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:22.960
Yangyang.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:24.280
- Lady Shen.
- Be careful!

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:25.580
- Jicai.
- Yangyang.

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:26.740
Be careful, be careful.

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:27.780
Yangyang.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.100
- Yangyang.
- Lady Shen.

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:31.820
Jicai.

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:33.210
Yangyang.

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:34.310
Yangyang.

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:35.540
- Jicai.
- Shen Shaoguang.

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:36.530
Yangyang.

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:38.180
Be careful.

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:39.960
Yangyang.

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:41.140
Yangyang.

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:42.980
Answer me.

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:43.980
Jicai.

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:45.300
- Mr. Lin.
- Shen Shao...

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.140
Mr. Lin, I'm here.

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:49.460
Yangyang.

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:50.430
- Over there.
- Hurry.

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:52.420
- Coming.
- I'm here.

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:54.660
- Yangyang.
- Mr. Lin, I'm here.

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:55.980
I'm here.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.180
- Father.
- Yangyang.

00:09:58.180 --> 00:09:59.780
- Grandpa, grandma.
- Yangyang.

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:01.620
Yangyang, are you OK?

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:02.990
- Did you hurt?
- Are you injured?

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:04.580
Are you OK?

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:06.860
- Yangyang.
- Where is your auntie?

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:07.700
Where is Jicai?

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:09.580
Yangyang, was auntie running with you?

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:11.380
My auntie diverted the bad guys

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.580
to save me.

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:17.140
She hasn't come back.

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:19.100
Yangyang, which way did your auntie go?

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:20.500
That direction.

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:54.060
Stop going further.

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:56.420
Come back with me obediently.

00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:58.540
I promise not to take your life.

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:02.620
Mr. Lin.

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:12.340
If it weren't useful to keep you alive,

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.840
you wouldn't have the chance
to play tricks with me here.

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:17.180
Since you're so good at causing trouble,

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:19.170
I'll cut off your hands and feet

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:20.470
and mutilate you.

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:21.420
No, no, no.

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:22.540
If so, it's meaningless

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:23.600
to take me as the hostage.

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:25.620
It's better to have four limbs intact.

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:27.340
I will never lie to you again.

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:32.420
Mr. Lin.

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:35.260
Do you think I will believe you
a second time?

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:51.900
She told you the truth,

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.140
but you don't believe it.

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:55.740
Mr. Lin.

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:56.590
Are you OK?

00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:58.020
It's dangerous here.

00:11:58.020 --> 00:11:58.860
Let's go first.

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:07.580

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:18.260
Hold on to me.

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:21.100
Mr. Lin, save me. Save me.

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:21.940
Don't worry.

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:23.900
I will definitely get you up.

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:26.860
Mr. Lin, do not let go.

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:28.100
I haven't lived enough yet.

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:30.380
There are still many things
I haven't eaten yet.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:31.980
I haven't yet made the Shen's Diner

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:32.900
bigger and stronger.

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:34.220
I also said I want

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:36.500
to make affordable food for everyone.

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:38.020

into treating you as a counterfeit

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:02.140
Alright, alright.

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:03.900
Come on.

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:04.780
Take care.

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:05.620
Come on.

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:08.620
What about him?

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:12.260
In this situation,

00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:13.740
we can't report it to the authorities.

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:15.140
What if we leave him here

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:16.700
and he gets eaten by beasts?

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.180
His identity is so special.

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:19.660
Why bother with him?

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:20.700
If beasts don't mind,

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:22.240
it could be considered his good fortune.

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.060
Someone will find him soon.

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:25.260
Let's go.

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:26.690
Liu Chang will come to meet us soon.

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:27.460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:28.700
- Stay close together.
- Hurry.

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:30.060
I don't want to stay here any longer.

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:31.020
- Quick.
- Quick, Yangyang.

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:31.860
Go, go, go.

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:40.820
Speed up.

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:46.820
(Virtue and Fragrance)

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:54.660
It's just a minor injury.

00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:57.260
I can recover without taking medicine.

00:18:57.820 --> 00:18:59.020
Take the medicine first.

00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:03.220
Wait a minute.

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:04.820
Your hand isn't convenient to use.

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:06.380
Let me help you.

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:13.340
I can do it myself.

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:19.340
My father and mother couldn't
bear it anymore.

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:20.900
They have to rest first.

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:23.340
Yangyang was frightened.

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:25.740
My brother must stay with her.

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:29.140
If you need something, just let me know.

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:46.540
Does it hurt?

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:49.900
No, it doesn't.

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:18.660
Sorry.

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:23.940
Let me do it.

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:31.180
(Qingyang Cui Case)

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:52.900
No idea who wrote this file.

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:55.040
This person must be good
at writing compositions.

00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:56.690
He can get full marks for presentation.

00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:59.530
Composing and writing
mean the same thing.

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:01.500
Writing compositions?

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:03.060
Isn't the meaning

00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:04.700
repeated?

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:05.860
Ignore it.

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:06.900
The point is

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:08.820
his presentation is very neat.

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:10.900
Ordinary people don't write articles
that carefully.

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:12.740
There will be some signs
of modification.

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:13.860
But he didn't.

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:15.540
As if it had been recopied.

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:23.300
(Qingyang Cui Case)

00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:26.460
(To be punished by the death penalty.)

00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:32.180
(Cao Mansion)

00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:35.900
(Qingyang Cui Case)

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:37.540
(Harboring ill intentions)

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:38.700
Just as you said,

00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:42.500
this file has no errors or omissions.

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:44.540
This is obviously a recopy.

00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:47.060
I was blinded by a single leaf.

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:49.240
I had been delving
into the contents of the file,

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:50.100
yet I never expected

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:52.860
that the key information lay
beyond the words themselves.

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:55.740
The case was so urgent back then.

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:57.110
Yet Master Xiao still took the time

00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:58.180
to copy it out deliberately

00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:01.040
and submit it to the Capital Prefecture
and the Court of Judicial Review.

00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:02.880
He must have secrets
that must be kept hidden.

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:06.950
Unfortunately,

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:09.900
Master Xiao is now in a coma.

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.490
We can't get anything out of him.

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:15.380
Fifth Master Xiao

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:18.300
is a taciturn person
who won't say a word.

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:21.340
However, he was very diligent
in writing.

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:24.140
Not only would he carry a tablet
when attending court meetings,

00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:25.830
but even while eating or walking,

00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:27.850
he would bring different kinds of slips

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:30.260
to record events that occurred.

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:32.100
So some people made fun of him,

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:34.220
saying he was no different
from those attendants

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:37.220
who constantly recorded the daily life
of His Majesty.

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:38.380
They gave him a nickname,

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:40.220
Attendant Prince Consort.

00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:42.900
So I suppose

00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:44.740
when he was investigating the case,

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:47.420
he would also carry a slip
to record events.

00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:57.820
If Prince Consort Xiao

00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:00.620
left behind that slip,

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:02.700
perhaps there will be new clues.

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:06.100
By the way,

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:07.850
(Secret letter)
Prince Zhao sent a letter,

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:10.580
saying that the hunt for the Shen family
was all Li Ang's nonsense.

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.190
He has already been taught a lesson.

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:15.820
When I was young,

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:17.820
even as a feudal prince,

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:19.460
if he felt he was wrong,

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:21.340
he would apologize to me.

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:23.660
I assumed that since he was reasonable

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:24.820
and free of airs,

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:26.740
he must be a fair-minded person.

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:28.990
Now he shifts all the responsibility
onto Li Ang.

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:30.540
This is just a tactic,

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.020
the same as when he showed sincerity

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:35.940
toward me.

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:38.480
In the case
of selling official positions,

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:40.620
many of the traded posts
were in the Ministry of War.

00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:41.900
Perhaps,

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:44.420
they are not after money at all.

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:47.140
If the ears, tongues, mouths, and eyes
in the court

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:48.700
are all replaced by others,

00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:50.580
that person

00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:52.620
would become a true 'lonely ruler'.

00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:53.900
Young Master,

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:55.180
I don't quite understand

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:57.380
what you mean by that.

00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:58.540
I mean

00:23:59.100 --> 00:23:59.940
Prince Zhao

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:01.900
may be related to all of this.

00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:03.620
His Majesty is aged

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:06.100
and still has a few brothers
in their prime.

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:08.460
Who could benefit from the case?

00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:12.820
If that were really the case,

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.510
Prince Zhao would certainly not want us

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:16.070
to continue investigating.

00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:17.880
Even if there are many suspicious points

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:19.140
about Prince Zhao,

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:21.560
that is still not enough to conclude

00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:23.980
that he was involved
in that incident back then.

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:28.420
Forget it for now.

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:29.700
At present,

00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:30.990
Prince Zhao also dared not rashly

00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:32.260
extend his reach into Yong'an.

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:33.820
He wrote this letter

00:24:34.410 --> 00:24:35.660
to keep us steady.

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:37.060
Both sides have their concerns.

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:38.790
The other party got anxious first.

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:40.940
Naturally, they'll lose their composure.

00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:43.220
Then would it be more appropriate for us

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:44.740
to send the Shen family away first?

00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:55.500
Greetings, Mr. Lin.

00:24:58.380 --> 00:24:59.580
We came to see

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:01.620
if your injury has gotten any better.

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:02.940
No major issues remain.

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:04.420
Thanks for your concern.

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:05.900
Come in and sit.

00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:09.920
We are here not only to visit you,

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:11.460
but also to tell you something.

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:14.420
That day in Sushui City,

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:17.560
Prince Zhao's youngest son
who was hunting down Jicai

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:19.960
came specifically to the dungeon
to interrogate us

00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:21.220
and asked us if we knew

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:22.420
your secrets.

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:24.260
There are things about you
that can be said,

00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:25.500
and things that cannot be said.

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:27.900
We didn't know what should be said

00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:29.060
and what should not be said.

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:30.220
I just thought

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:31.180
you told me

00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:32.460
that Prince Zhao knows

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:33.540
your true identity.

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:37.260
That day when you took off clothes

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:38.260
in the carriage...

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:48.740
It's not that.

00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:51.160
That day, Mr. Lin was wearing
his official uniform.

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:52.340
He couldn't go to a restaurant

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:53.460
wearing his official uniform.

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:54.740
He could only change temporarily.

00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:03.540
Is she really so unconcerned about it?

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:04.940
So

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:07.660
you said you know my identity?

00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:11.380
Well,

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:13.180
just to save my life,

00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:15.540
I still had to say something
they don't know,

00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:17.620
without affecting you.

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:19.500
So I said

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.540
you and the Princess
have an ambiguous relationship.

00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:23.220
Sorry for affecting your reputation.

00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:33.140
It's just reputation.

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:35.400
It's better than letting them
hurt you...

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:40.420
And you.

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:43.100
It doesn't matter.

00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:44.980
After all, it's because of me

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:46.660
that you had to suffer this calamity.

00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:50.300
Mr. Lin,

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:51.500
we are all one family.

00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:52.820
No need to say such things.

00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:55.060
Actually, we all know in our hearts

00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:57.460
that you're trying to reverse the case
for the Cui family.

00:26:58.320 --> 00:26:59.190
- Yeah.
- Well,

00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:01.100
does Prince Zhao taking us as hostages

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:02.820
have anything to do with it?

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:07.720
Alright. If Mr. Lin doesn't want
to talk about it,

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:08.780
we won't ask then.

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:11.060
Don't worry.

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:12.540
I will risk my life

00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:13.940
to protect you all.

00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:14.500
I know

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:16.700
people's perception of life and death
is very different.

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:18.730
They think many things
are more important than life.

00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:20.660
But you are like family to us.

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.300
We only hope that our family

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:23.700
can live well.

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:26.620
Mr. Lin, let me say a few words too.

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:28.900
As the head of this family...

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:36.140
The head's husband.

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:37.460
I make a statement.

00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:38.660
First of all,

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:40.980
reversing the case
is extremely important.

00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:44.060
Secondly, Prince Zhao has been secretly
setting you up.

00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:44.980
Before we came here,

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:46.460
we've discussed it in meetings.

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:47.300
We decided

00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:49.140
to stand firmly by your side

00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:50.740
and help you to reverse the case.

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:51.780
You can't.

00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:53.100
Why not?

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:54.020
Well,

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:55.820
ever since we arrived in Yong'an City,

00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:57.540
we've received a lot of help from you.

00:27:58.010 --> 00:27:59.410
And I can also tell

00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:00.500
all of this

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:02.460
comes from the bottom of your heart.

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:03.740
So we definitely won't

00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:04.980
leave you behind and ignore you.

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:05.940
Exactly.

00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:06.980
Mr. Lin,

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:08.600
there's one more thing
I want to ask you.

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:09.620
Logically speaking,

00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:11.060
we should have moved out long ago.

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:13.020
But if we move out now,

00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:14.380
then it will be much easier

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:16.340
for others to harm us.

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:17.900
As for this matter,

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.340
you still have to make a decision.

00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:20.820
Sorry for implicating all of you.

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:22.590
Although the engagement is called off,

00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:23.620
you all

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:26.420
are my only family in the world.

00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:27.700
I'm thinking

00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:30.380
I feel at ease only when I keep you
by my side.

00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:33.020
The road ahead won't be easy.

00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:35.260
Listen.

00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:36.420
Mr. Lin has already

00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:37.700
made so many plans for us.

00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:38.820
Mr. Lin,

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:41.380
actually, in our eyes,

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:43.100
you are just a child after all.

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:43.980
How did you manage

00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:45.740
to shoulder so much all by yourself?

00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:46.740
Didn't Mr. Lin say

00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:48.340
he also wants us to stay?

00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:49.820
Mr. Lin, from now on,

00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:51.090
you no longer need to be afraid.

00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:51.900
If something happens,

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:53.500
we adults will stand up for you.

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:54.660
We will stand up for you.

00:28:58.450 --> 00:28:59.340
Come on, father...

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:00.340
In this situation,

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:02.140
'adults' means parents.

00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:03.860
Whatever.

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:05.100
In my eyes,

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:07.260
Mr. Lin is just like you and Gongcai.

00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:08.540
You are all children of our family.

00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:09.380
Right?

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:10.300
Mr. Lin,

00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:11.380
as long as you are willing,

00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:12.260
from now on,

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:13.400
you can feel free to treat us

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:14.740
as your own parents.

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:20.100
It's not appropriate.

00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:21.500
What's inappropriate about it?

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:23.340
It's appropriate.

00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:25.060
I think it's very appropriate.

00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:26.140
From this day forward,

00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:28.060
just treat us like your parents.

00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:28.980
Yeah.

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:29.860
It's appropriate?

00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:31.260
Then according to that,

00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:32.860
from now on, you're my little brother.

00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:34.020
Brother,

00:29:34.090 --> 00:29:34.980
don't worry.

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:36.780
No matter how difficult
the road ahead is,

00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:38.140
the two of us

00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:39.420
will face it together.

00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:01.020
What's going on?

00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:02.860
What's wrong, Mr. Liu?

00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:04.380
Something got into my eyes.

00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:06.260
I... I'll rub it.

00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:10.020
I'm so touched.

00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:11.620
From now on, we are all your family.

00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:12.860
We're all one family now.

00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:16.990
- We are all one family.
- Come on.

00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:20.380
- Come on.
- We're family.

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:24.740
(Shen's Diner)

00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:28.420
(Distracted while eating,
being a laid-back person)

00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:31.060
Isn't a restaurant
just like a teahouse?

00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:32.640
Since ancient times, all kinds of people

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:34.680
all liked to come to such places
to discuss matters.

00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:36.740
We keep our eyes on all sides

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:38.160
and our ears open in all directions,

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:39.100
and maybe we can pick up

00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:40.300
some useful information

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:41.580
to help Mr. Lin.

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:43.420
Why are you standing here

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:44.270
instead of cooking?

00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:46.100
Didn't we say we need
to gather intelligence?

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:46.940
I have to do it.

00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:47.780
This is a man's job.

00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:48.820
You women can't do it.

00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:49.860
It's dangerous.

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:51.140
Listen to your words.

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:52.700
I think you should be taught a lesson.

00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:53.820
Go cook. Go.

00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:55.060
Dear. Dear.

00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:56.700
Look at Shaojie.

00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:01.500
Speak louder.

00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:03.340
What're you doing?
Not going to let us eat?

00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:04.190
What's wrong with you?

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:05.880
- You do business like this?
- Quick, go.

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:07.290
- It's OK. Go ahead.
- Owner?

00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:08.130
Where's the owner?

00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:09.500
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:10.780
Sorry.

00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:12.380
His brain, you know,

00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:13.900
there's something wrong with it.

00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:15.100
This Agate Meat

00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:16.060
is free of charge.

00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:17.490
Enjoy yourself.

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:20.860
- The customers
- What would you like?

00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:22.290
- or the passersby,
- Some of this.

00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:24.590
- might be the spies.
- Chicken wings, got it.

00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:29.380
OK.

00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:30.620
Thank you.

00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:31.740
Shaojie went out.

00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:33.860
Step aside.

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:40.100
Come on.

00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:41.080
What are you looking at?

00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:41.950
I'm following someone.

00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:43.420
Who are you following?

00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:44.580
Well, that person.

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:45.430
Did you see him?

00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:46.580
He definitely has a problem.

00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:47.420
What's the problem?

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:49.100
It's not even winter yet.

00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:50.660
He sneezed four times in a row.

00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:51.600
What does this indicate?

00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:52.780
He must have used the sneezing

00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:53.820
to send a signal.

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:55.980
Well, who did he inherit
such low IQ from?

00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:56.820
From you.

00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:57.820
From whom?

00:31:58.180 --> 00:31:59.150
Come on. He's gone away.

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:00.070
- Come on.
- Trust me.

00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:01.470
Do you have a problem with your eyes

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:02.180
or your brain?

00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:03.700
(Shen's Diner)

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:04.740
He really has a problem.

00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:06.620
Help him reverse the case?

00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:08.860
I think you're just trying
to get attention.

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:09.700
I... Well...

00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:11.220
You're so jumpy and overreacting.

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:12.500
You want to gather information?

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:14.080
The information you found out

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:15.890
may be deliberately revealed
by someone else.

00:32:15.890 --> 00:32:16.790
- I...
- Gongcai,

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:18.980
Mr. Lin is having a hard time.

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:20.120
Even though we couldn't help,

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:21.350
don't make things worse either.

00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:22.100
- Father,
- I...

00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:24.140
what exactly can you do well?

00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:25.660
I...

00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:31.900
(Clear and Bright)

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:32.750
Mr. Lin,

00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:33.640
I

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:35.020
have one piece of news.

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:36.540
Third Master Wen,

00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:39.420
who has a big mole on his face,

00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:41.890
has a cousin who works
in the Imperial Kitchen.

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:43.100
According to him,

00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:44.420
His Majesty

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:46.220
doesn't have a good appetite.

00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:48.260
Later, I made more inquiries
in various ways.

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:49.610
This did happen.

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:51.380
This is definitely big news.

00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:53.820
Yes, I also tried.

00:32:54.490 --> 00:32:56.020
After my extensive inquiries,

00:32:56.020 --> 00:32:56.940
I discovered

00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:58.140
the sworn brother of the son

00:32:58.140 --> 00:32:59.480
of the second aunt of the cousin

00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:00.740
of the wife of the third brother

00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:02.270
of that Aunt Ge who delivers fish to us

00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:02.780
is a member

00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:04.260
of the Jinwu Guards.

00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:05.580
They've been

00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:07.260
investigating the cat theft case.

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:17.300
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:19.700
His Majesty lost his cat.

00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:20.900
That's a cat, after all.

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:22.700
Isn't this already big news?

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:24.900
This cat has already been found.

00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:25.980
The Crown Prince liked it,

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:27.960
so he secretly took it away
for a few days.

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:29.790
His Majesty has already
given him a lesson.

00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:31.460
By the way, Mr. Lin,

00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:32.940
I found out

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:36.140
Mr. Meng, Left Supervisor,

00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:38.940
is quite worried
about his granddaughter's marriage.

00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:41.340
I heard his daughter's marriage
was not very good,

00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:42.540
and she died in depression.

00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:45.260
He doesn't want his granddaughter
to repeat the same mistake.

00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:48.340
Mr. Meng also mentioned it to me.

00:33:57.140 --> 00:33:58.180
Marriage?

00:33:58.520 --> 00:33:59.620
Did you agree?

00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:00.980
Did you agree?

00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:04.300
No, no, no.

00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:05.180
If Mr. Lin agreed,

00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:06.520
then the whole Yong'an would know.

00:34:06.530 --> 00:34:07.980
Yeah, you can't agree.

00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:09.220
You're moved?

00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:10.580
You're moved?

00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:19.900
Father, mother,

00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:20.940
this is a private matter.

00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:22.100
Let's not interfere anymore.

00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:23.540
Yes.

00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:33.300
Thank you all

00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:35.060
for helping me discover

00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:36.940
so many secrets of the capital.

00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:41.140
Actually, recently we've been

00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:43.120
studying the matter
of Yangyang going to school.

00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:44.930
For most girls,
their families would invite

00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:46.330
a teacher to come and give lessons.

00:34:46.330 --> 00:34:47.380
We've met with some people.

00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:48.580
But we were not very satisfied.

00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:50.060
After some inquiries,

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:52.780
we learned that the best academy
is Hongwen Academy.

00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:55.180
Grand Tutor Zhao Xunzhi
is also teaching here.

00:34:55.690 --> 00:34:56.540
I inquired...

00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:58.020
Well, when did you inquire?

00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:00.220
You're quite a competent auntie.

00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:02.700
I found out from this person,

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:04.560
the sworn brother of the son
of the second aunt

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:06.440
of the cousin of the wife
of the third brother

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:07.790
of that Aunt Ge, who delivers fish.

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:08.920
The one who is a Jinwu guard.

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:10.260
He said that 20 years ago,

00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:12.300
Zhao Xunzhi was a disciple
of the Capital Prefect.

00:35:12.330 --> 00:35:13.660
Why didn't he tell me?

00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:15.540
He really was my father's disciple.

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:17.260
But after something happened
in my family,

00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:18.390
he wanted to avoid suspicion,

00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:19.720
so he never mentioned it again.

00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:25.980
(Benefiting and Helping the People)

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:27.700
Sachets. Sachets.

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:29.660
Sachets with various scents.

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:30.700
Lady, take a look.

00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:31.560
I found out

00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:35.220
Mr. Meng, Left Supervisor,

00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:37.900
is quite worried
about his granddaughter's marriage.

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:39.780
Mr. Meng also mentioned it to me.

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:43.060
- What's wrong, milady?
- Take a look.

00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:44.420
Do you have something on your mind?

00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:45.700
No.

00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:47.020
Not really.

00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:48.540
Why do you ask like that?

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:51.240
You seem absent-minded today.

00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:52.270
It's fragrant.

00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:53.590
Lady, take a look.

00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:57.940
Alright, actually I read a novel.

00:35:57.940 --> 00:35:58.900
It's quite cruel.

00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:01.340
Why are you reading that for no reason?

00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:02.380
That stuff is so difficult.

00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:03.160
Can it not be cruel?

00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:06.540
What are you saying?

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:08.580
I mean, I read

00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:09.860
a sad story.

00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:12.360
What story?

00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:13.540
In the story,

00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:15.060
that lady

00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:17.460
accidentally fell off a cliff.

00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:18.540
At this time,

00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:20.580
a handsome young man came to rescue her.

00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:22.620
She thought, 'better you than me'.

00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:24.180
She didn't care if his arm was broken,

00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:25.780
as long as he could save her.

00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:28.680
This young lady is really heartless.

00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:30.340
Yes.

00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:33.460
Despite being such a heartless person,

00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:35.500
she was actually willing
to let herself fall

00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:37.240
to save the life of the one
who rescued her.

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:38.940
Then she must really love that person.

00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:40.140
No way, how could that be?

00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:47.140
It's not important.

00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:48.580
Anyway,

00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:51.060
this lifesaver will eventually
marry someone else.

00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:53.340
How can the story be like this?

00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:55.940
That young lady will be sad.

00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:57.140
No, she is not sad.

00:36:57.140 --> 00:36:58.180
How could she be sad?

00:36:58.180 --> 00:36:59.380
This is too perverse.

00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:01.300
Milady, why are you so excited?

00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:02.550
What exactly do you want to say?

00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:03.540
Why can't I understand?

00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:07.220
It's nothing.

00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:09.020
Really, it's nothing.

00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:16.740
(Yunshui Manor)

00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:29.980
We're friends.

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:31.420
How could you say you serve me?

00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:34.540
Didn't you say before

00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:36.220
that you don't plan to make friends?

00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:39.860
People change.

00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:41.860
Then we are friends now.

00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:43.380
In Future Village,

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:45.700
friends should shake hands.

00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:53.740
Hold on to me.

00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:55.180
Don't let go.

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:17.100
(Shaoguang's Food Notes.
So hard.)

00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:18.310
(For eating spicy food,
we risked our lives.)

00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:19.960
(All because there are
no chili peppers here.)

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:21.190
(If people in Yong'an wanna
eat something spicy,)

00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:22.440
(they rely on Sichuan pepper, ginger,
, piper longum, and evodia fruit.)

00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:23.380
(Some are actually quite expensive.)

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:24.720
(The smartweed we happened to find
while on the run)

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:26.280
(is used as an ingredient
for making fermentation starter.)

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:27.480
(It's rarely eaten directly.)

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:29.240

that familiar stinging sensation...)
