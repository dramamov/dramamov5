I'm Michael Merton's son.

Siwat Merton...

00:02:43.994 --> 00:02:45.715
He looks really familiar.

00:02:46.174 --> 00:02:48.195
Well, you and I met him yesterday.

00:02:49.686 --> 00:02:51.548
It's like I've seen him somewhere else

00:02:52.312 --> 00:02:53.512
a long time ago,

00:02:54.748 --> 00:02:56.261
but I can't pinpoint when.

00:02:56.755 --> 00:02:57.793
But right now,

00:02:57.794 --> 00:02:59.974
what's important is his last name.

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:02.784
Merton...

00:03:03.417 --> 00:03:06.530
Is it the same surname
as Uncle Singkhon's friend?

00:03:07.461 --> 00:03:09.184
What was his name?

00:03:11.032 --> 00:03:11.994
It's Michael.

00:03:16.806 --> 00:03:17.994

- Uh,

it's alright, Aunt Kate.

- But...
- Don't worry about the money.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.994

00:04:33.864 --> 00:04:34.944
so...

Oh, that's right.

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.723

I have.

00:04:49.475 --> 00:04:50.864
What did he say?

00:04:51.017 --> 00:04:52.937
Khun still doesn't know, Auntie Kate.

00:04:53.774 --> 00:04:56.983
Is there something I should know?

00:04:56.984 --> 00:04:57.592
There is!

00:05:03.044 --> 00:05:03.744
Got it.

00:05:14.523 --> 00:05:15.141
Khun!

00:05:15.144 --> 00:05:16.195
Calm down!

Nothing...

Nothing.

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:26.554
Khun...

Khun!

Why are you here?!

00:05:28.124 --> 00:05:29.303
Calm down, Khun!

00:05:29.304 --> 00:05:31.010
What do you want?!

00:05:31.014 --> 00:05:32.901
Calm down!

00:05:32.904 --> 00:05:33.993
Let him go, Khun!!

00:05:33.994 --> 00:05:35.994
- Calm down, Khun!
- Let go of me!

00:05:36.952 --> 00:05:38.183
You helped him,

00:05:38.184 --> 00:05:41.153
knowing he's the son of that bastard Michael?!

00:05:41.154 --> 00:05:42.603
Why do you talk about my father like that!?

00:05:43.184 --> 00:05:44.503
What did he ever do to you?

00:05:44.504 --> 00:05:45.344
Huh?!

00:05:46.348 --> 00:05:48.559
Khun, stop!

00:05:49.454 --> 00:05:49.994
You f*cker!

00:05:49.995 --> 00:05:51.994
Stop it! Both of you!

00:05:53.774 --> 00:05:54.755
Khun, stop!

00:05:55.119 --> 00:05:56.290
That's enough!

00:06:01.046 --> 00:06:02.246
Get out of here!

00:06:02.683 --> 00:06:03.519
Go away!!

00:06:04.057 --> 00:06:05.657
You can't let him go like that.

00:06:05.994 --> 00:06:07.994
Mr. Siwat has every right to be here.

00:06:08.486 --> 00:06:10.610
I won't let a murderer's son stay here!

00:06:11.994 --> 00:06:15.043
Mr. Siwat is a donor to our rescue fund!

00:06:15.044 --> 00:06:16.828
He has every right to be here, Khun!

00:06:18.421 --> 00:06:19.824
I can't believe

00:06:20.115 --> 00:06:23.141
that you're siding with the son
of my father's murderer!

00:06:23.994 --> 00:06:27.323
And you're using the fund
as an excuse for me to let him stay here?!

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:29.548
Khun.

00:06:30.617 --> 00:06:31.759
You need to differentiate

00:06:31.994 --> 00:06:33.490
between the two of them!

00:06:33.994 --> 00:06:36.493
You can't involve Mr. Siwat with the past!

00:06:36.494 --> 00:06:37.994
He doesn't know anything about it!

00:06:38.406 --> 00:06:40.486
Besides, Michael has already died.

00:06:41.468 --> 00:06:42.915
He should've died by my own hands,

00:06:43.784 --> 00:06:46.152
not f*cking dying
without paying for what he did.

00:06:47.446 --> 00:06:50.014
We're way past that, Khun.

00:06:50.341 --> 00:06:52.748
When you said to open up the homestay again,

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:54.464
weren't you the one telling me

00:06:54.835 --> 00:06:57.464
that you wouldn't let the past get in the way?

00:07:01.388 --> 00:07:02.377
I know...

00:07:02.959 --> 00:07:05.781
that if I told you to let it go,

00:07:06.164 --> 00:07:07.475
it would sound selfish.

00:07:09.774 --> 00:07:11.803
But I want Mr. Siwat
to stay here just for now.

00:07:12.363 --> 00:07:13.454
It's intolerable!

00:07:13.844 --> 00:07:16.581
Letting that murderer's son
be here at Dad's place?

00:07:17.344 --> 00:07:19.994
Just hang on until he's better, couldn't you?

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:22.494
I've been hanging on since the day father died

00:07:22.604 --> 00:07:24.581
since you begged me not to seek revenge!

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:27.090
But if you're asking me to endure this again,

00:07:29.846 --> 00:07:30.952
I will do so.

00:07:32.424 --> 00:07:35.119
Maybe you've already forgotten
all the pain from the day he died,

00:07:35.628 --> 00:07:36.944
but I haven't!

00:07:52.304 --> 00:07:54.224
Could anyone please tell me

00:07:54.624 --> 00:07:56.501
what happened between him and my father?

00:08:40.137 --> 00:08:41.301
It's intolerable!

00:08:41.621 --> 00:08:44.479
Letting that murderer's son
be here at Dad's place?

00:08:44.624 --> 00:08:47.337
Just hang on until he's better, couldn't you?

00:08:51.592 --> 00:08:53.563
I've been hanging on since the day father died

00:08:53.564 --> 00:08:55.570
since you begged me not to seek revenge!

00:08:55.994 --> 00:08:57.994
But if you're asking me to endure it again,

00:08:58.290 --> 00:08:59.403
I will do so.

00:09:05.679 --> 00:09:08.210
Maybe you've already forgotten
all the pain from the day he died,

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:10.552
but I haven't!

00:09:30.319 --> 00:09:31.994
Miss Lookwaii,
you're really good at dressing wounds.

00:09:33.461 --> 00:09:34.581
She's a doctor.

00:09:35.192 --> 00:09:37.994
But I've already quit my job
to join the rescue team.

00:09:38.675 --> 00:09:39.994
No wonder you're light-handed.

00:09:41.934 --> 00:09:43.112
I apologize for Khun.

00:09:43.919 --> 00:09:45.024
He's hot-tempered;

00:09:45.434 --> 00:09:46.552
nobody could handle him.

00:09:47.439 --> 00:09:49.039
It's fine. I don't mind.

00:09:49.994 --> 00:09:50.930
All is understood.

00:09:52.675 --> 00:09:54.334
Speaking of which,

00:09:54.566 --> 00:09:56.515
what's going on with you and your guy?

00:09:57.024 --> 00:09:58.254
You came here together,

00:09:59.148 --> 00:09:59.994
so...

00:10:00.694 --> 00:10:02.959
is he really gonna hurt you like Khun said?

00:10:03.861 --> 00:10:05.490
I'm worried he's gonna pull up here.

00:10:09.994 --> 00:10:11.548
I'm not sure about this.

00:10:12.694 --> 00:10:14.181
All I know is that

00:10:14.184 --> 00:10:15.526
Dean is now a danger.

00:10:16.334 --> 00:10:17.994
You guys have to be careful.

00:10:18.697 --> 00:10:20.784
He's skilled in Thai boxing, knives, and guns,

00:10:21.904 --> 00:10:23.994
since he's trained to be
my personal bodyguard.

00:10:24.764 --> 00:10:25.497
Well, well,

00:10:25.657 --> 00:10:27.994
let's see how he'll put up with Kor here.

00:10:30.341 --> 00:10:31.599
Shut up!

00:10:33.148 --> 00:10:34.995
I'll protect you while you're here.

00:10:39.674 --> 00:10:40.414
What?

00:10:40.654 --> 00:10:42.333
He's the son of my mother's friend!

00:10:42.334 --> 00:10:43.555
I gotta take care of him!

00:10:45.824 --> 00:10:47.803
I'll contact a homestay I know.

00:10:48.363 --> 00:10:49.817
What, Mom?

00:10:50.304 --> 00:10:52.508
Are you kicking him out,

00:10:52.704 --> 00:10:54.726
even though he's injured,

00:10:54.952 --> 00:10:56.937
only because Khun's stupid prejudice?!

00:10:58.964 --> 00:11:00.697
This is my decision.

00:11:04.784 --> 00:11:05.781
I'm sorry,

00:11:06.283 --> 00:11:08.450
but I don't want you or Khun
to be uncomfortable.

00:11:08.614 --> 00:11:10.174
They can mind their own business!

00:11:10.755 --> 00:11:12.799
He's gotta be here for his safety,

00:11:12.804 --> 00:11:14.450
and I'll take care of him!

00:11:14.988 --> 00:11:16.210
But I made my decision

00:11:16.214 --> 00:11:17.994
because it's best for everyone!

00:11:18.319 --> 00:11:20.743
Mom, you gotta listen to your son,

00:11:20.744 --> 00:11:22.246
not a nephew like him!

00:11:25.814 --> 00:11:26.428
Kor?

00:11:26.603 --> 00:11:27.134
Yes, ma'am?

00:11:27.694 --> 00:11:29.352
- Get the car.
- No need!

00:11:30.057 --> 00:11:31.621
Mr. Siwat needs to be here.

00:11:46.537 --> 00:11:47.330
Be careful.

00:11:54.574 --> 00:11:56.479
Mr. Siwat, you'll take this one.

00:12:01.024 --> 00:12:02.253
About...

00:12:02.254 --> 00:12:04.195
Thara and Khunkhao earlier,

00:12:05.003 --> 00:12:06.472
I...

00:12:07.417 --> 00:12:08.486
I really am sorry

00:12:09.243 --> 00:12:10.668
that I had to do that to you.

00:12:12.784 --> 00:12:13.883
But all this time,

00:12:13.994 --> 00:12:15.534
Khun has also been suffering.

00:12:17.912 --> 00:12:18.995
I understand

00:12:19.272 --> 00:12:21.134
how loss...

00:12:21.417 --> 00:12:22.217
actually feels.

00:12:24.404 --> 00:12:25.994
Khunkhao believes

00:12:26.326 --> 00:12:28.232
that Uncle Singkhon's death

00:12:28.574 --> 00:12:30.486
has something to do with my father.

00:12:31.919 --> 00:12:33.861
Could you tell me

00:12:33.994 --> 00:12:35.548
what actually happened, Aunt Kate?

00:12:35.744 --> 00:12:36.595
Why...

00:12:37.221 --> 00:12:38.814
I already did what you asked, Thara.

00:12:39.424 --> 00:12:39.994
Yes, Mom.

00:12:41.352 --> 00:12:42.994
Feel free to give me a call
if you need anything.

00:12:43.279 --> 00:12:44.166
No need to hesitate.

00:12:50.724 --> 00:12:52.472
I'm here to find Tambralinga.

00:12:56.094 --> 00:12:57.598
I need Khunkhao's help.

00:12:57.599 --> 00:12:58.312
That can't be.

00:12:59.403 --> 00:13:01.994
It's embedded in Khunkhao's mind
that Singkhon died because of it.

00:13:02.864 --> 00:13:04.232
If you want to stay here,

00:13:04.377 --> 00:13:07.388
don't let Khun hear about finding Tambralinga!

00:13:10.661 --> 00:13:11.679
Give me your word.

00:13:13.494 --> 00:13:14.268
Of course.

00:13:16.724 --> 00:13:18.588
I'll have Thara bring you blankets.

00:13:19.635 --> 00:13:20.501
Thank you.

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:27.592
Thanks.

00:13:28.661 --> 00:13:29.344
No problem.

00:13:46.614 --> 00:13:49.003
What happened between
Father and Uncle Singkhon?

00:14:02.094 --> 00:14:02.704
Be careful.

00:14:02.705 --> 00:14:03.694
Let go.

00:14:07.381 --> 00:14:08.217
It's tight, isn't it?

00:14:11.765 --> 00:14:18.456
♫Keep my love safe and sound 'til that day♫

00:14:24.471 --> 00:14:25.351
Hm.

00:14:25.535 --> 00:14:27.904
Yes, schedule the appointment for the morning.

00:14:29.227 --> 00:14:31.838
I think there are more X-rays to be done, yeah.

00:14:56.653 --> 00:14:57.373
Yo!

00:14:57.955 --> 00:14:58.864
The h*ll are you doing?

00:14:59.191 --> 00:15:00.100
Are you free or something?

00:15:00.529 --> 00:15:01.795
You know how long I took arranging that?

00:15:02.856 --> 00:15:03.535
None of your business.

00:15:04.478 --> 00:15:05.911
Why were you rummaging through that?

00:15:06.995 --> 00:15:08.158
Be straight with me,

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:10.318
are you annoyed because of Mr. Siwat?

00:15:10.878 --> 00:15:11.824
Just feel sorry for him.

00:15:12.449 --> 00:15:13.940
He watched his dad die,

00:15:13.945 --> 00:15:16.115
and the news even caught everything in detail.

00:15:17.635 --> 00:15:18.614
Geez.

00:15:18.615 --> 00:15:20.464
Calm down, will you?

00:15:20.465 --> 00:15:22.085
Pun's just messing with you!

00:15:24.185 --> 00:15:25.824
Right, and if you see Mr. Siwat,

00:15:25.825 --> 00:15:28.551
tell him I've already scheduled
him an appointment at the hospital.

00:15:30.075 --> 00:15:31.205
Why me?

00:15:31.307 --> 00:15:32.449
Tell him yourself!

00:15:36.375 --> 00:15:37.082
Bro?

00:15:38.136 --> 00:15:39.535
Clean up after yourself.

00:15:40.405 --> 00:15:41.575
How about in exchange for your allowance?

00:15:42.216 --> 00:15:43.535
I'll clean up after you, then.

00:15:46.175 --> 00:15:47.249
F*ck's wrong with him?

00:16:34.209 --> 00:16:34.776
What?

00:16:34.777 --> 00:16:35.889
Get out of my way!

00:16:45.325 --> 00:16:46.529
The h*ll's wrong with him?

00:16:47.198 --> 00:16:48.238
Why so moody?

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:49.285
Are you nuts!?

00:16:55.535 --> 00:16:56.238
Bro,

00:16:56.239 --> 00:16:57.794
last night's game ended 2-0.

00:16:57.795 --> 00:16:59.944
- D'you see?
- Wait 'til next time!

00:16:59.945 --> 00:17:01.176
- Mr. Kor, Mr. Thara.
- Oh?

00:17:01.889 --> 00:17:04.394
I've got your car from the park,

00:17:04.395 --> 00:17:06.376
so I brought your luggage, too.

00:17:07.535 --> 00:17:08.042
Uh,

00:17:08.045 --> 00:17:10.694
I think I've got another bag
with something important...

00:17:10.695 --> 00:17:11.395
This one?

00:17:11.396 --> 00:17:12.238
Oh, that's the one!

00:17:12.665 --> 00:17:14.284
Here, Kor found it at the scene,

00:17:14.285 --> 00:17:15.535
so he picked it up for you.

00:17:16.311 --> 00:17:17.234
Thank you, Mr. Kor.

00:17:17.235 --> 00:17:18.294
No worries, brother!

00:17:18.295 --> 00:17:18.973
This one, too.

00:17:18.975 --> 00:17:20.558
- It's in your bag.
- Oh, thank you, bro.

00:17:21.535 --> 00:17:22.515
Are you gonna soak your feet?

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:23.933
I am.

00:17:23.935 --> 00:17:24.791
Let me help.

00:17:25.005 --> 00:17:26.020
Thank you so much.

00:17:26.602 --> 00:17:27.535
Be careful.

00:17:29.755 --> 00:17:32.074
Actually, if you want to reduce swelling,

00:17:32.075 --> 00:17:33.293
you've gotta add some ice to it.

00:17:33.438 --> 00:17:34.420
You're right, but...

00:17:34.645 --> 00:17:36.204
I don't think I've seen any ice around.

00:17:36.205 --> 00:17:37.438
Right, here it is.

00:17:37.998 --> 00:17:39.654
It's actually for your drinks,

00:17:39.655 --> 00:17:41.094
but this will do for now.

00:17:41.095 --> 00:17:41.991
I'll get you more.

00:17:42.296 --> 00:17:43.118
Alright, then.

00:17:45.111 --> 00:17:46.595
There it goes!

00:17:52.093 --> 00:17:53.438
Oh, let me help!

00:17:53.535 --> 00:17:54.405
Wait a sec.

00:17:54.565 --> 00:17:54.975
Oh,

00:17:54.975 --> 00:17:56.364
I can take care of it, Mr. Thara!

00:17:56.365 --> 00:17:57.402
It's alright!

00:17:58.085 --> 00:17:58.973
Be careful.

00:17:59.111 --> 00:18:00.100
Let go.

00:18:02.711 --> 00:18:03.329
Hold on...

00:18:03.915 --> 00:18:05.024
Easy.

00:18:13.575 --> 00:18:14.340
It's tight, isn't it?

00:18:17.575 --> 00:18:18.733
Now bring your feet down.

00:18:18.735 --> 00:18:20.005
- It's a little cold.
- Alright.

00:18:21.169 --> 00:18:21.976
That's really cold!

00:18:23.045 --> 00:18:24.374
Soak for 15 minutes,

00:18:24.375 --> 00:18:25.575
every 2 hours.

00:18:25.911 --> 00:18:26.929
Don't leave it for too long.

00:18:27.104 --> 00:18:27.604
Alright.

00:18:31.695 --> 00:18:32.260
Whoa.

00:18:34.435 --> 00:18:35.104
Put this away.

00:18:45.642 --> 00:18:46.915
If it's too much, I'll give you a hand.

00:18:47.165 --> 00:18:48.820
- I'm fine. This is nothing.
- Alright.

00:18:55.085 --> 00:18:56.315
Here's your crutch.

00:18:56.515 --> 00:18:57.620
I'll leave it here

00:18:57.625 --> 00:18:58.922
so you can walk more comfortably.

00:18:59.482 --> 00:19:00.471
Alright, thank you.

00:19:01.205 --> 00:19:02.404
And this...

00:19:02.405 --> 00:19:03.205
The highlight.

00:19:03.575 --> 00:19:04.275
Whoa!

00:19:04.276 --> 00:19:05.802
Mom told me to bring it to you.

00:19:06.391 --> 00:19:08.907
And they are all my favorite dishes, too!

00:19:17.031 --> 00:19:18.434
If you need anything,

00:19:18.435 --> 00:19:20.398
don't hesitate to say it.

00:19:20.682 --> 00:19:21.535
I'm off.

00:19:21.969 --> 00:19:22.515
Uh,

00:19:22.516 --> 00:19:23.787
hold on, Mr. Thara.

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:27.184
I don't think I can finish this much food.

00:19:27.535 --> 00:19:28.435
Let's eat together!

00:19:28.525 --> 00:19:29.315
Can I really?

00:19:29.409 --> 00:19:30.005
Of course!

00:19:30.006 --> 00:19:31.213
- Please be my guest!
- Wow...

00:19:49.191 --> 00:19:49.691
Mm!

00:19:50.209 --> 00:19:50.842
Delicious!

00:19:50.995 --> 00:19:51.715
Bussin'!

00:19:52.784 --> 00:19:53.700
Yes, bussin'!

00:19:53.705 --> 00:19:54.820
- Bussin'!
- Bussin'!

00:20:25.695 --> 00:20:26.544
Pun!

00:20:26.842 --> 00:20:27.575
Yes, sir?!

00:20:32.595 --> 00:20:34.187
Why didn't you close the gate?

00:20:38.405 --> 00:20:39.482
I'm sorry.

00:20:41.038 --> 00:20:41.538
Geez...

00:20:49.671 --> 00:20:51.824
But I want Mr. Siwat to stay here just for now

00:20:52.551 --> 00:20:54.536
because he's just lost his father!

00:20:55.191 --> 00:20:57.169
And he's being hunted down,

00:20:57.575 --> 00:20:59.373
so he's really struggling!

00:20:59.758 --> 00:21:01.329
Could you have any sympathy for him?

00:21:17.365 --> 00:21:18.425
Siwat, my son...

00:21:19.816 --> 00:21:20.485
Father!

00:21:22.464 --> 00:21:22.980
Father...

00:21:24.515 --> 00:21:25.125
Ow...

00:21:28.435 --> 00:21:29.125
Argh...

00:21:30.071 --> 00:21:30.718
Ugh...

00:21:33.816 --> 00:21:34.449
- Go...
- Father!

00:21:35.205 --> 00:21:35.925
Hurry...

00:21:36.667 --> 00:21:37.475
Siwat...

00:21:37.645 --> 00:21:38.325
Father...

00:21:39.867 --> 00:21:40.529
Siwat...

00:21:40.827 --> 00:21:41.329
Go...

00:21:41.889 --> 00:21:42.217
No!

00:21:42.217 --> 00:21:43.535
- Run away...
- No!

00:21:43.685 --> 00:21:44.245
Father!

00:21:50.115 --> 00:21:51.307
Listen to me, son...

00:21:53.176 --> 00:21:54.289
Find...

00:21:54.945 --> 00:21:56.551
Tambralinga...

00:21:58.165 --> 00:21:59.322
It's gonna...

00:22:00.675 --> 00:22:02.325
lift your curse...

00:22:02.755 --> 00:22:03.605
No!

00:22:03.962 --> 00:22:05.613
Come with me, Father!
You've gotta come with me!

00:22:05.615 --> 00:22:07.358
Don't leave me, Father!

00:22:07.816 --> 00:22:09.344
Come with me!!

00:22:09.345 --> 00:22:10.049
Listen to me...

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:11.395
- Father...
- Listen...

00:22:11.535 --> 00:22:12.631
- Run!
- Father!

00:22:12.635 --> 00:22:13.802
Go!!

00:22:19.322 --> 00:22:20.405
Maria and Aisoon...

00:22:21.535 --> 00:22:23.405
It's because of Maria and Aisoon!

00:22:51.125 --> 00:22:52.231
Father!

00:22:57.169 --> 00:22:59.515
Father!!

00:23:00.587 --> 00:23:03.535
Father!!

00:23:08.769 --> 00:23:09.751
Father!!

00:23:14.507 --> 00:23:15.162
Wait,

00:23:17.751 --> 00:23:18.522
what was that noise?

00:23:18.835 --> 00:23:19.286
Uh...

00:23:19.286 --> 00:23:20.827
It's from Mr. Siwat's room.

00:23:27.758 --> 00:23:29.344
Why'd you tell me to close the gate,

00:23:29.535 --> 00:23:30.573
if you're jumping over it?

00:23:41.816 --> 00:23:42.565
Hey!

00:23:43.205 --> 00:23:43.824
You!

00:23:44.435 --> 00:23:45.315
Open the door!

00:23:53.293 --> 00:23:54.500
Can you hear me?!

00:23:54.973 --> 00:23:55.809
Hey!

00:24:10.827 --> 00:24:12.558
Your scream woke up the entire house.

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:14.827
I don't want anyone dying here!

00:24:16.565 --> 00:24:17.534
My bad.

00:24:17.535 --> 00:24:19.787
I dreamed about the moment my father died.

00:24:25.409 --> 00:24:26.427
Just feel sorry for him.

00:24:26.765 --> 00:24:28.155
He watched his dad die in front of him,

00:24:28.289 --> 00:24:30.427
and the news even caught everything in detail.

00:24:52.893 --> 00:24:53.875
You have a fever.

00:24:58.845 --> 00:24:59.744
I'll be back.

00:25:19.816 --> 00:25:21.147
- Take off your pants, too.
- What?!

00:25:21.424 --> 00:25:22.107
Hey!

00:25:22.108 --> 00:25:23.133
Calm down!

00:25:25.256 --> 00:25:26.355
What are you embarrassed about?

00:25:28.645 --> 00:25:29.293
Hey!

00:25:30.037 --> 00:25:36.088
♫My love for you never evanesces♫

00:25:43.703 --> 00:25:44.430
Take this.

00:26:01.666 --> 00:26:02.641
Take off your shirt.

00:26:15.626 --> 00:26:16.597
Let me help.

00:26:28.052 --> 00:26:28.779
Come on.

00:26:33.816 --> 00:26:34.772
Easy.

00:26:35.496 --> 00:26:36.190
Here.

00:26:58.394 --> 00:26:59.143
C'mon,

00:26:59.146 --> 00:27:00.132
I'll do it for you.

00:27:25.877 --> 00:27:26.626
Stand up.

00:27:30.736 --> 00:27:32.176
- Take off your pants, too.
- What?!

00:27:34.226 --> 00:27:35.768
How else would I wipe you?

00:27:36.714 --> 00:27:37.710
Are you serious?

00:27:41.946 --> 00:27:42.786
Hey!

00:27:43.848 --> 00:27:45.436
Calm down!

00:28:15.252 --> 00:28:16.466
What are you embarrassed about?

00:28:18.056 --> 00:28:19.659
Who's embarrassed? I'm not embarrassed.

00:28:25.848 --> 00:28:26.554
Whoa!

00:28:26.936 --> 00:28:27.994
Not there.

00:28:28.166 --> 00:28:29.274
I'll do it myself.

00:28:30.386 --> 00:28:31.063
Here.

00:28:52.976 --> 00:28:53.688
Here you go.

00:28:53.819 --> 00:28:54.372
Give that to me.

00:29:02.616 --> 00:29:03.797
Lift your leg slowly.

00:29:06.776 --> 00:29:07.725
I'll help.

00:29:36.488 --> 00:29:38.685
Be careful, it's a bit hard to put on.

00:29:42.634 --> 00:29:43.928
Your arm goes in first, then.

00:30:07.034 --> 00:30:07.892
Thank you.

00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:08.852
Sit down.

00:30:29.936 --> 00:30:30.786
Hold out your hand.

00:30:37.066 --> 00:30:38.561
Hold out your hand!

00:30:44.532 --> 00:30:45.950
This is a quartz Shiva lingam pendant.

00:30:46.401 --> 00:30:48.459
It has the ability to relieve your pain.

00:30:53.126 --> 00:30:54.539
- But if you don't believe...
- I do.

00:31:14.903 --> 00:31:15.892
Close your eyes.

00:32:07.681 --> 00:32:08.634
What did you see?!

00:32:09.826 --> 00:32:10.503
I...

00:32:11.816 --> 00:32:12.466
Huh?!

00:32:12.757 --> 00:32:13.746
- What did you see?!
- I...

00:32:14.396 --> 00:32:15.186
I saw...

00:32:16.285 --> 00:32:18.677
It's embedded in Khunkhao's mind
that Singkhon died because of it.

00:32:19.150 --> 00:32:20.705
If you want to stay here,

00:32:20.706 --> 00:32:23.706
don't let Khun hear about finding Tambralinga!

00:32:26.866 --> 00:32:28.379
I didn't see anything.

00:32:48.161 --> 00:32:49.015
Anyway,

00:32:49.016 --> 00:32:50.816
thank you for letting me stay.

00:32:51.936 --> 00:32:54.088
I'll let you stay until you get better.

00:32:55.586 --> 00:32:57.256
But if you cause trouble,

00:32:57.526 --> 00:32:59.266
you're immediately walking out the door.

00:33:00.496 --> 00:33:01.266
Sure.

00:34:41.565 --> 00:34:42.910
This is a quartz Shiva lingam pendant.

00:34:43.436 --> 00:34:45.436
It has the ability to relieve your pain.

00:34:48.266 --> 00:34:49.376
That's sick!

00:34:49.436 --> 00:34:50.248
How is that even possible?

00:34:52.816 --> 00:34:54.663
One, two, three, four,

00:34:54.666 --> 00:34:56.465
five, six, seven, eight!

00:34:56.466 --> 00:34:58.314
One, two, three, four,

00:34:58.316 --> 00:34:59.994
five, six, seven, eight!

00:34:59.996 --> 00:35:01.892
One, two, three, four,

00:35:01.896 --> 00:35:03.436
five, six, seven, eight!

00:35:03.652 --> 00:35:05.223
One, two, three, four,

00:35:05.226 --> 00:35:06.735
five, six, seven, eight!

00:35:06.736 --> 00:35:07.128
Come on!

00:35:07.129 --> 00:35:08.885
One, two, three, four,

00:35:08.886 --> 00:35:10.321
five, six, seven, eight!

00:35:10.326 --> 00:35:11.925
One, two, three, four,

00:35:11.926 --> 00:35:13.435
five, six, seven, eight!

00:35:13.436 --> 00:35:14.256
Okay, you go!

00:35:14.257 --> 00:35:16.035
One, two, three, four,

00:35:16.036 --> 00:35:17.841
five, six, seven, eight!

00:35:17.846 --> 00:35:19.645
One, two, three, four,

00:35:19.646 --> 00:35:21.092
five, six, seven, eight!

00:35:21.096 --> 00:35:21.645
Let's go, let's go!

00:35:21.646 --> 00:35:23.325
One, two, three, four,

00:35:23.326 --> 00:35:24.961
five, six, seven, eight!

00:35:24.966 --> 00:35:26.525
One, two, three, four,

00:35:26.526 --> 00:35:27.972
five, six, seven, eight!

00:35:32.037 --> 00:35:33.754
Don't put too much weight on your foot!

00:35:34.154 --> 00:35:35.608
Why aren't you using your crutch?!

00:35:38.136 --> 00:35:38.663
Uh...

00:35:38.772 --> 00:35:40.066
- Whoa!
- Don't slack off!

00:35:56.346 --> 00:35:57.345
Let's go! Jump! Star jump!

00:35:57.346 --> 00:35:59.005
One, two, three, four,

00:35:59.006 --> 00:36:00.515
five, six, seven, eight!

00:36:00.516 --> 00:36:02.241
- One, two, three, four,
- One, two, three, four,

00:36:02.266 --> 00:36:03.702
- five, six, seven, eight!
- five, six, seven, eight!

00:36:03.727 --> 00:36:05.292
- One, two, three, four,
- One, two, three, four,

00:36:05.299 --> 00:36:06.832
- five, six, seven, eight!
- five, six, seven, eight!

00:36:17.026 --> 00:36:18.343
Why are you in my room?

00:36:19.106 --> 00:36:20.277
Give me back my necklace!

00:36:20.532 --> 00:36:21.077
No!

00:36:23.303 --> 00:36:23.726
Hey!

00:36:24.124 --> 00:36:28.953
♫There's only you there inside my heart♫

00:36:28.957 --> 00:36:30.989
♫My love for you never evanesces♫

00:36:31.062 --> 00:36:32.967
Ugh, seriously?

00:36:33.277 --> 00:36:35.520
Old Klai just brought us the chicken!

00:36:35.658 --> 00:36:38.124
Do you know how long it takes to marinate?!

00:36:38.364 --> 00:36:40.406
If the car hadn't broken down,
I would've been here sooner!

00:36:40.407 --> 00:36:41.896
Now quit complaining!

00:36:41.897 --> 00:36:42.966
Oof!

00:36:42.967 --> 00:36:44.916
That's it, I'm mad now!
You're so harsh, Pudding!

00:36:44.917 --> 00:36:45.767
Hmph!

00:36:47.644 --> 00:36:49.382
Goodness, "Pudding."

00:36:49.651 --> 00:36:51.356
- One, two, three, four,
- One, two, three, four,

00:36:51.357 --> 00:36:52.926
- five, six, seven, eight!
- five, six, seven, eight!

00:36:52.927 --> 00:36:54.366
- One, two, three, four,
- One, two, three, four,

00:36:54.367 --> 00:36:57.251
- five, six, seven, eight! One, two, three...
- Harden it up!

00:36:57.629 --> 00:36:59.086
- five, six, seven, eight!
- five, six, seven, eight!

00:36:59.087 --> 00:37:00.636
- One, two, three, four,
- One, two, three, four,

00:37:00.637 --> 00:37:02.175
- five, six, seven, eight!
- Harden it up!

00:37:02.177 --> 00:37:02.807
One, two...

00:37:02.808 --> 00:37:05.207
Run like you mean it!

00:37:05.324 --> 00:37:06.636
One, two, three, four.

00:37:06.637 --> 00:37:08.366
Or else I'm gonna cut your allowance!

00:37:08.367 --> 00:37:09.629
Especially for you, Pun.

00:37:45.227 --> 00:37:46.400
Oh, that's good!

00:37:48.599 --> 00:37:49.506
Stronger!

00:37:55.789 --> 00:37:56.720
Get him, now!

00:38:10.957 --> 00:38:12.131
Okay, well done!

00:38:13.697 --> 00:38:14.815
That...

00:38:14.817 --> 00:38:16.131
was so d*mn amazing, Kor.

00:38:16.937 --> 00:38:18.044
Winning against a woman?

00:38:18.218 --> 00:38:19.244
What is there to be proud of?

00:38:19.673 --> 00:38:20.582
C'mon.

00:38:20.587 --> 00:38:21.717
Just be proud.

00:38:21.897 --> 00:38:22.880
This guy...

00:38:25.357 --> 00:38:26.349
Next time,

00:38:26.487 --> 00:38:27.615
let's do a rematch.

00:38:28.407 --> 00:38:29.897
Anytime, with you.

00:38:30.429 --> 00:38:31.397
No take-backs.

00:38:33.367 --> 00:38:34.684
Kiddos!

00:38:34.887 --> 00:38:36.626
- How was it, Uncle Klai?
- Your meal is here!

00:38:36.727 --> 00:38:38.677
- I think it's gonna get better next time.
- Watch your step.

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:39.786
I'll deliver it to the market.

00:38:39.787 --> 00:38:40.966
Hurry along!

00:38:40.967 --> 00:38:41.724
Fried chicken and sticky rice!

00:38:41.727 --> 00:38:43.040
- Please take care of it for me.
- Of course.

00:38:44.582 --> 00:38:45.680
Here you go.

00:38:45.897 --> 00:38:46.487
Wow!

00:38:46.488 --> 00:38:47.455
Dig in!

00:38:47.457 --> 00:38:48.626
All fresh and hot!

00:38:49.244 --> 00:38:50.526
What took you guys so long, Mind?

00:38:50.527 --> 00:38:51.756
You know what did?

00:38:51.757 --> 00:38:52.986
It's because Old Klai

00:38:52.987 --> 00:38:55.084
took so long to bring me the chicken!

00:38:55.087 --> 00:38:57.386
So how was I supposed to fry them in time?

00:38:57.387 --> 00:38:59.476
That's why you all had to wait for so long!

00:38:59.477 --> 00:39:01.163
For goodness' sake! With these complaints,

00:39:01.164 --> 00:39:02.556
you're gonna rupture their eardrums!

00:39:02.557 --> 00:39:03.382
Ugh!

00:39:03.387 --> 00:39:04.509
I don't like you now.

00:39:06.997 --> 00:39:07.651
Four...

00:39:10.507 --> 00:39:11.011
Huh?

00:39:11.487 --> 00:39:12.320
What?

00:39:13.377 --> 00:39:14.058
Here you go.

00:39:15.484 --> 00:39:16.684
These look appetizing.

00:39:18.182 --> 00:39:19.491
Where's the new kid?

00:39:22.829 --> 00:39:24.026
There he is!

00:39:24.027 --> 00:39:24.647
Ooh!

00:39:29.047 --> 00:39:29.651
Hello.

00:39:29.652 --> 00:39:31.406
Hi there.

00:39:31.407 --> 00:39:32.422
Oh...

00:39:33.062 --> 00:39:34.646
Are you the boy

00:39:34.647 --> 00:39:36.640
who Mind said was being hunted down?

00:39:37.127 --> 00:39:37.760
That's right.

00:39:37.857 --> 00:39:38.917
Poor you.

00:39:39.171 --> 00:39:41.856
- There, there, my dear.
- Oi, oi, that's too much.

00:39:41.857 --> 00:39:43.606
That's too much.

00:39:43.607 --> 00:39:44.975
- Yeah, no.
- Oh, oh...

00:39:45.607 --> 00:39:46.298
Pudding!

00:39:46.967 --> 00:39:48.226
Stay here.

00:39:48.407 --> 00:39:49.135
Trust me.

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:51.484
No one can hurt you now.

00:39:52.218 --> 00:39:53.469
Thank you, Uncle...

00:39:53.658 --> 00:39:54.575
- Klai.
- Klai.

00:39:54.577 --> 00:39:54.931
Yeah!

00:39:54.932 --> 00:39:56.236
- And Auntie Lek.
- Auntie Lek.

00:39:56.237 --> 00:39:57.469
No need for the embrace.

00:39:58.589 --> 00:40:00.349
- Acting all defensive!
- Mr. Siwat,

00:40:00.527 --> 00:40:03.462
Auntie Lek made us
Phrom Khiri's signature fried chicken.

00:40:03.897 --> 00:40:05.644
Eat it with some hot sticky rice.

00:40:05.647 --> 00:40:06.800
I guarantee...

00:40:06.902 --> 00:40:07.447
It's delish!

00:40:07.666 --> 00:40:08.720
I'll have to try it, then.

00:40:08.931 --> 00:40:09.856
- Come sit.
- Go ahead and sit!

00:40:09.857 --> 00:40:11.098
- Go on.
- Hurry!

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:12.386
I can walk by myself!

00:40:12.387 --> 00:40:14.313
- Thank you.
- Or else we're gonna both fall.

00:40:14.317 --> 00:40:15.896
Look at you being all reserved!

00:40:15.897 --> 00:40:17.542
I can just push you right now!

00:40:18.058 --> 00:40:19.018
Come sit, Auntie.

00:40:19.498 --> 00:40:20.204
Yeah.

00:40:24.698 --> 00:40:25.731
Here you go, the sticky rice.

00:40:26.367 --> 00:40:27.775
- I'll do it. Thank you.
- I'm hungry.

00:40:29.407 --> 00:40:30.255
We're all out.

00:40:41.993 --> 00:40:42.815
Are you full?

00:40:43.578 --> 00:40:44.975
- I am.
- You're starting to, right?

00:40:44.977 --> 00:40:45.767
I'm starting to.

00:40:45.897 --> 00:40:46.866
- I'm completely full.
- I'm stuffed!

00:40:50.429 --> 00:40:51.018
Yeah,

00:40:51.019 --> 00:40:52.516
the soft bone has the crunch.

00:40:52.517 --> 00:40:53.586
It's the cartilage.

00:40:56.393 --> 00:40:57.896
So you like it soft?

00:40:57.897 --> 00:40:59.857
Geez!

00:41:03.357 --> 00:41:04.953
Eat it with the sticky rice, too.

00:41:06.307 --> 00:41:07.055
Not bad.

00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:08.277
Mr. Siwat?

00:41:08.815 --> 00:41:09.897
Where are you going?

00:41:10.618 --> 00:41:11.266
Uh,

00:41:11.702 --> 00:41:13.897
I was gonna excuse myself to the toilet.

00:41:14.538 --> 00:41:17.375
I'll come back to Auntie Lek's fried chicken.

00:41:17.897 --> 00:41:18.873
Of course!

00:41:18.877 --> 00:41:20.167
Watch your step.

00:41:20.306 --> 00:41:21.295
I'll be back.

00:41:21.593 --> 00:41:22.727
Thank you, ma'am.

00:41:22.917 --> 00:41:23.775
Pudding,

00:41:23.857 --> 00:41:24.887
I'll take him there.

00:41:25.077 --> 00:41:26.640
No, stay where you are.

00:41:27.142 --> 00:41:28.975
You need to learn how to stay still.

00:41:29.215 --> 00:41:31.367
Alright, I won't.

00:41:31.658 --> 00:41:32.880
Are you jealous?

00:41:33.164 --> 00:41:34.633
No, I'm annoyed.

00:41:34.727 --> 00:41:35.367
Is that so?

00:41:35.695 --> 00:41:37.056
Are you saying I'm annoying?

00:41:37.057 --> 00:41:37.753
I'm not.

00:42:05.897 --> 00:42:07.157
Pudding, eat this!

00:42:08.087 --> 00:42:09.571
I still have some on my plate!

00:42:44.157 --> 00:42:45.607
This must be Uncle Singkhon.

00:42:53.644 --> 00:42:55.586
He looks annoying even in the photo.

00:43:52.291 --> 00:43:53.535
Why are you in my room?

00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:58.567
Give me back my necklace!

00:43:59.535 --> 00:44:00.284
No!

00:44:02.477 --> 00:44:04.037
Last night, you sensed it, didn't you?

00:44:06.589 --> 00:44:08.189
Take me to Tambralinga.

00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:10.546
I need this to open its gate!

00:44:12.887 --> 00:44:13.857
Nonsense!

00:44:14.087 --> 00:44:15.484
Stop looking for that city!

00:44:16.837 --> 00:44:17.857
Give that back!

00:44:18.102 --> 00:44:19.055
- Give that to me!
- Hands off!

00:44:19.477 --> 00:44:19.816
No...

00:44:19.817 --> 00:44:20.640
Give it back to me!

00:44:20.909 --> 00:44:22.269
- I told you to give it to me!!
- Let go!

00:44:22.497 --> 00:44:23.622
Give it back!!

00:44:24.698 --> 00:44:25.382
No.

00:44:29.084 --> 00:44:29.746
Siwat!

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:36.858
I need to find Tambralinga!

00:44:36.917 --> 00:44:37.857
Let go of me!

00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:38.989
No!

00:44:39.171 --> 00:44:40.371
Give me back my necklace!

00:44:40.717 --> 00:44:41.506
Let me go...

00:44:41.942 --> 00:44:43.382
I'm losing control of myself!!

00:44:44.211 --> 00:44:46.531
Let go!!

00:45:34.182 --> 00:45:34.902
Mr. Siwat?

00:45:35.047 --> 00:45:36.456
Has Khun already taken you to the hospital?

00:45:36.457 --> 00:45:37.382
Don't you have eyes?

00:45:37.387 --> 00:45:38.247
Nosy jerk.

00:45:38.538 --> 00:45:40.044
Even if what happened between us was true,

00:45:40.047 --> 00:45:42.426
or that Tambralinga city
is truly in Khao Luang,

00:45:42.427 --> 00:45:44.146
I'll bury that city with my own hands

00:45:44.327 --> 00:45:47.222
so that it doesn't
cause any chaos in my forest!

00:45:47.227 --> 00:45:50.647
Fate will bring the Yoni stone
and the Shiva lingam quartz together.

00:45:50.793 --> 00:45:53.091
Soon, the Four Element Benders will appear.

00:45:53.302 --> 00:45:55.556
And once the gate to Tambralinga opens again,

00:45:55.557 --> 00:45:58.796
we will use these two stones
to awaken Kalakal's atman.

00:45:58.797 --> 00:45:59.656
What the h*ll is that?!

00:45:59.657 --> 00:46:00.386
Siwat!

00:46:01.135 --> 00:46:02.266
You're a monster!

00:46:02.267 --> 00:46:03.957
Argh!!
