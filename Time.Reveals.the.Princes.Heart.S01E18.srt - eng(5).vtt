WEBVTT

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.680
Young Master Liu.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:17.720
Master Liu.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.920
Long time no see.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:19.920
It's been a while.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.060
I'm not quite used to this.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.400
It's fine.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.330
I'm here for you.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.220
Why don't you go get something to eat?

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.240
It's been a long time.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.039
Indeed it has.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.039
How's business?

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.500
Not bad.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.320
Thanks to you.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.400
Still counting on your support.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.039
Today, the young master

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:54.320
looks so spirited.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.960
You two look like

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.400
newlyweds in honeymoon.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:58.759
I wonder

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.440
if I could ask you for a dance?

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.160
Young Master, you're not still holding a grudge, are you?

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.290
You should ask Sinan to dance with you.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.240
Young Master,

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.759
what era are we living in?

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.300
Why are your thoughts so old-fashioned?

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.290
Why are you still so conservative?

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.320
Everyone,

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.160
tonight we have merchants gathered from everywhere.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.760
I've heard

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.760
that the Liu family's young master and Miss Xu

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.200
are excellent dancers.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.960
Why don't

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.600
we ask them to perform a dance

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.200
to entertain us all?

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.640
Great!

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.720
Dance! Dance!

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.680
I asked you to dance,

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.640
but you refused.

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:39.400
Now look what's happened.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.600
Everyone is waiting.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.680
You wouldn't be so petty

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.890
as to disappoint everyone, would you?

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.680
Fine.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.010
Silin, have you forgotten?

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.160
We were once

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.760
engaged to each other.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.760
What's the point of telling me this

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:14.880
now?

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.800
If you hadn't pretended to be insane back then,

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.680
perhaps

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.530
I would be married to you by now.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.400
Since childhood,

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.520
whether it's family background or education,

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.600
you've always been far superior to Liu Sinan.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.680
Do you know

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.930
that you've always been the one I love?

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.480
But my father at that time

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.480
insisted I get engaged to Liu Sinan.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.600
But now

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.040
he regrets it.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.480
Enough.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.400
Stop.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.520
You are Liu Sinan's wife now.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.800
Saying these things to me

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:51.940
is inappropriate.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.600
I don't care if you want to hear it or not,

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.880
I'm going to say it anyway.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:55.760
Silin,

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.760
I want to start over with you.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.880
Enough!

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.520
We never had anything to begin with,

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.850
so how can we start over?

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.120
Why do you care so much about a maid?

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.400
She's not worthy of you.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.680
You are the legitimate son of the Liu family.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.880
How could you possibly be with a housekeeper's daughter?

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.120
Do you remember this sachet you gave me?

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.650
I've always kept it with me.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.480
Silin...

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:19.040
Get out!

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.240
Yiyu!

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.520
Don't listen to what she said.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.120
She's doing this on purpose.

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:34.360
I just found out today

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.600
that you've always been the one she loves.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.960
How can you believe what someone like her says?

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.680
Whether she loves me or not has nothing to do with me.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.880
You're the one I love.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.600
She's right.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.330
I truly am not worthy of you.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:47.680
Yiyu!

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:51.960
When I pretended to be insane, everyone despised me.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.690
Only you didn't look down on me.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:54.760
For my sake,

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:55.890
for the restaurant,

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.450
you sacrificed so much.

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:59.820
How could you say such a thing?

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.240
Perhaps.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.240
If I hadn't appeared in the first place,

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.840
there would be no 'perhaps.'

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.740
That year when I first met you at the alley entrance,

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.130
I knew it was you.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.320
It's because I listened to all of you back then

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.850
that I ended up in this mess.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.520
How can I not be anxious?

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.920
Plan.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:48.680
What plan do you have

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.610
to completely take down Liu Silin?

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.480
Guo Zixin.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:59.640
Zixin.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.680
You've been hiding here for so long.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.280
I appreciate your patience.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.200
Are you

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.040
really planning to let Liu Silin go?

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.280
Qian Yiyu keeps protecting him.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.120
I can't bring myself to do it.

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.050
You have feelings for Yiyu.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:21.690
What?

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.200
No,

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.890
it's because she resembles Xiuhe.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:29.800
Liu Silin's schemes

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.480
may be far more devious than either of us imagined.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.920
He's been playing the fool for years,

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.220
scheming all along to become the head of the family.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.360
Moreover, he's now buddies with the Qinglong Gang.

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.840
Perhaps they were in cahoots all along.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:48.920
Perhaps Xiuhe

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.240
knew some secret about Liu Silin from back then,

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.240
and that's why...

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:00.640
Yiyu

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.220
might also be manipulated by him.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.520
I can't believe after all these years,

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.360
Brother Silin still loves osmanthus cake so much.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.080
Your taste hasn't changed at all.

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:32.210
Hey, Brother Silin,

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.400
was it when my father had me bring you osmanthus cakes

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.480
that year

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.180
that you started to like them?

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.060
What exactly are you trying to do?

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.680
What am I trying to do?

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.680
I already explained everything clearly to you in private.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:49.480
What's wrong?

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.640
Do you want me to repeat it again?

00:07:54.159 --> 00:07:55.080
Let's go.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:01.680
Miss Xu,

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.160
I remember you were once engaged to Silin.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.620
But what does that matter?

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:07.800
Do you truly love him?

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.640
If you loved him,

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.960
would you have broken the engagement when he was in trouble?

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.080
Now that Silin has become the head of the Liu family,

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:16.520
you're back in the picture.

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.880
I think the only person you love is yourself.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:19.810
What did you say?

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:21.920
Now, Silin and I,

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.360
I love him and he loves me.

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.160
That's all that matters.

00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:58.800
Search everything!

00:08:58.800 --> 00:08:59.330
Yes, sir.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.480
Who authorized you to do this?

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.480
Stop immediately!

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:08.680
What are you doing?

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.920
Someone reported that your Liu family restaurant

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.320
is hiding illegal items.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.040
This is a search warrant.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.240
Sorry about this,

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:20.280
young master Liu.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.160
How is this possible?

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:24.690
There must be some mistake.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:25.840
How could there be a mistake?

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.920
The informant clearly specified your establishment,

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.160
Fulu Grand Restaurant.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.090
In this Yun City,

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.170
is there another Fulu Restaurant?

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:33.930
Keep searching.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.800
Boss, we found it.

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:42.160
Look.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.040
Well, well.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:47.680
Your restaurant

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:48.920
dares to hide opium.

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.160
Now we've caught you red-handed.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:52.720
What do you have to say for yourselves?

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:53.580
Take them away.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:54.280
I...

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.560
There must be some mistake.

00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:58.040
Yiyu.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.880
How could our restaurant have such things?

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.480
I have no idea either.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.240
Liu Silin.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:08.040
You're selling dog meat as lamb.

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:11.240
Using your restaurant as a cover

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.480
to run your shady business.

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:16.480
You'd better confess honestly

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.920
to avoid more suffering.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.200
I really didn't do it.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:22.800
The opium isn't yours?

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.930
Did it grow legs and walk into your restaurant by itself?

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:27.120
That opium

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.680
was found in your restaurant's kitchen.

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:31.560
Chief,

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.800
I've been framed.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.600
We've caught you red-handed

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.600
and you're still denying it.

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:42.000
Don't you know General Wu hates opium the most?

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.560
Yet you still dare to challenge him.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.240
No wonder you became the head of the Liu family.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.360
It was all through opium trafficking.

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.960
The opium really isn't mine.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.120
It's not mine.

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.480
Look carefully.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.600
These are all your inventory records.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.840
Although they say 'tea' on them,

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.040
the quantities match exactly

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.450
with the opium we found.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.480
What else do you have to say?

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:10.680
And here's your seal.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:12.560
Liu Silin.

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.280
I advise you to confess honestly

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.610
to avoid further physical suffering.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.420
It's not like that.

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:20.160
Chief,

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:21.680
even if you beat me to death,

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.280
I still didn't do it, Chief.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.040
Fine,

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.770
I'll beat you to death then.

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:26.680
Beat him!

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:27.080
Chief!

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.240
Beat him until he confesses.

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:29.840
I really didn't do it, Chief.

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.580
How is the young master doing?

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.600
The young master has been tortured for confession.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.730
He's badly injured.

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.160
Madam,

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.160
please think of something quickly!

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:15.020
Director Wang.

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.200
Director Wang.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:21.680
Madam,

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.160
you're not here to plead for Liu Silin, are you?

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:26.480
It's useless.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.440
I'm not here to plead for him.

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.050
I'm here to confess.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.600
Do you realize what you're saying?

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.120
Trafficking opium!

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.520
Do you know what consequences you'll face?

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.530
I know exactly what I'm saying.

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.920
The opium found at Fulu Restaurant was hidden by me.

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:47.290
I've been selling opium behind Liu Silin's back.

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:49.770
He truly knows nothing about this.

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:14.440
Yu.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.200
