WEBVTT

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.920
Wei.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.450
In the 14th year of Tang Tianbao reign.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:49.880
The An-Shi Rebellion broke out.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.240
Emperor Xuanzong of Tang

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.840
abandoned the city and fled.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.610
Eunuch Chen Jingbian was left to guard Chang'an.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.620
Unexpectedly, Chen Jingbian immediately defected to An Lushan.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.120
Chang'an fell, spies emerged everywhere.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.900
This defense battle was a great victory.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.690
The Tang army was defeated.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.580
Prefect Wei, your contribution is invaluable.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.320
My small contribution means nothing.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.330
It's all thanks to your extraordinary abilities, Lord Chen

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.060
and your brilliant strategy.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.600
The Night Firefly Painting.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.360
At this wonderful banquet,

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.920
may I ask to see

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.440
the Night Firefly Painting in your possession?

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.080
That's just a rumor.

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.320
When have I ever owned such a thing?

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.880
Magistrate Wei, you jest.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.760
It's coming from the Star-Plucking Hall.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.560
Someone triggered a mechanism.

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:29.410
What's the panic about?

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.320
Li Ling

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:35.770
At your service.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.840
Keep one alive.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.160
Yes.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.690
Wang Cong

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.560
Here.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.320
Go help now.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.840
Yes.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:01.620
After them!

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:02.480
Yes.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.080
Hurry!

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.240
Go!

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.040
Don't run!

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.840
Stop!

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.880
Get back!

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.640
Civilians stay away!

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.240
Officer Li

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:24.680
that's not fair.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.620
We all came chasing together.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.079
Our Manager Wang instructed

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.000
we can search,

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.520
but we need to divide the areas first.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.600
Otherwise, who gets credit for the capture?

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.560
Don't you agree?

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.880
Very well.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.490
If this character faces up,

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.280
you can choose your area.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.600
Doctor, help me!

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.060
Be careful!

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.900
What brings you here, sir?

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.040
Have you seen a thief?

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:19.880
No, I haven't.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.320
Is that so?

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.360
Search the place!

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.890
Yes, sir.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.280
What's your name?

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.159
Nongyu.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.340
Where are you from?

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.159
Shanzhou.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.320
What do you do?

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.120
I run a clinic.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.120
Heal the sick

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.780
save lives.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.180
Travel permit.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.600
A woman like you

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.920
should stay in the west

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.160
instead of coming to Chang'an

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.690
during such chaotic times.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.560
Sir, what are you saying?

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:08.680
I heard that

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.160
Chang'an is now under Great Yan's rule

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.000
and everyone is living well.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.640
That's why I traveled so far to come here.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.300
Is this person on the document

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.580
you?

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.130
Yes, it's me.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.000
Very well.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.180
According to this travel permit,

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.170
there should be a birthmark

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.760
on the back of your neck.

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:41.420
What are you afraid of?

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.800
Many have checked my permit,

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.120
but you're the first one

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.780
who wants to see my birthmark.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.880
I don't know if this permit

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.080
belongs to you or not.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.380
But this dagger

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.610
definitely belongs to you.

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.000
I'm just a helpless woman

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.080
in a foreign land.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.080
If I encounter villains,

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.040
I can only take my own life

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.360
to preserve my chastity.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.200
Is that wrong?

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.660
Don't move.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:23.860
It's really there.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.000
I think I heard something over here.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.800
Officer Li, we found something.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.000
Open it up.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:32.330
Yes, sir.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:33.640
Don't touch that!

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.040
I told you not to touch anything.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.040
These are medicinal insects and snakes.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.800
If they bite someone, it could be dangerous.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.060
If you lose any of them,

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.970
you won't be able to afford the compensation.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.640
A quack doctor

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:55.560
practicing black magic.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:59.450
Let's go.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:16.920
Sir, slow down.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.440
Reporting to Lord Chen.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:26.440
I have failed you.

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:27.700
The thief got away.

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.280
My men and I

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.480
searched every street and alley for that thief.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:32.920
But Wang Cong sent his men

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.080
following us the whole time.

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.320
Making a commotion and causing confusion.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:37.400
I suspect the thief

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.280
has already been hidden by them.

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.340
I was so angry that I confronted them.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.760
But the men from the Guard Office accused me

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:43.760
of obstructing their search.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.040
They said I was competing with Wang Cong for credit.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.040
Is that true?

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:52.640
All right.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.280
I finally have some free time.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.159
Can't you just let me enjoy some music?

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.360
You may go now.

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:03.010
Yes, sir.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:09.600
Shiyuan.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:10.760
Tongluan.

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:12.520
Please continue.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:22.720
Since you're already here,

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.120
don't just stand outside.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:24.680
Come in.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.880
How did you know I was coming?

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.850
I not only knew you were coming,

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.280
I also know that you and he

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:39.679
are accomplices.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.840
I made a spontaneous decision to save this young man.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.300
The situation was urgent,

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.140
and hasty hiding inevitably leaves traces.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.520
I was planning to find a chance to wipe away the bloodstains,

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.000
but you beat me to it.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.090
Impressive skills indeed.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:03.240
Indeed.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.610
Good skills are no match for keen eyes.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.730
Your name is Nongyu, right?

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.170
Why did you risk saving him?

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.280
If I tell you

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.280
he resembles my brother,

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.320
would you believe me?

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:23.480
Then let me put it another way.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.140
As a healer,

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.240
with compassion,

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:28.040
how could I watch someone die without helping?

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:28.480
I see.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:29.560
Thank you.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.760
But I still need to take him with me.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:32.880
You can't take him.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:34.880
If he leaves this room,

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:36.140
he will certainly die.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:37.090
What do you mean?

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.600
Well, I'm just an unorthodox

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:39.680
wandering witch doctor.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.240
Who knows if the medicine I just gave him

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.600
contained poison or not?

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.960
And only I can provide the antidote.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.720
Young lady, it seems you want something in return.

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:49.820
Tell me,

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.170
what do you want?

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:53.800
I want to enter Chen's mansion

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.130
and meet Chen Jingbian.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:55.760
And you

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:56.890
will help me.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.120
You're dreaming.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.300
You have no choice.

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:37.290
Yang Fang

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:44.040

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:44.880
Xie Zheng

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:45.530
