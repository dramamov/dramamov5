WEBVTT

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.920
Wei.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.440
Stop pricking yourself.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.560
It's painful to watch.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.610
Besides,

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.240
are those few drops of your blood really effective?

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.840
Master.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.840
Back when I was in the palace,

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.010
I frequently visited the Imperial Hospital.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.720
Looking for medicinal catalysts for His Majesty.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.850
I've seen all sorts of strange things.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.920
Like

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.760
sugarcane that survived three years of frost,

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.020
crickets raised by legitimate couples,

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.800
soil from the center of a decade-old stove.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.340
It drove me crazy trying to find them.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.440
Later I realized

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.280
they were all just excuses.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.000
All pretexts in case the medicine didn't work.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.960
I understand what you're thinking.

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:44.240
You just want me to see your dedication.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.520
So I'll sympathize with you more.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.160
Master,

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.039
I...

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.800
Alright.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.570
You're just showing your loyalty.

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.160
I don't blame you.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.800
To receive Master's affection

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.060
is Nongyu's blessing.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.460
You're speaking too soon.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.040
We've barely begun.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.199
Don't forget,

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.290
I haven't fulfilled my promise to you yet.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.000
I haven't granted your wish.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.840
Since you know how to make medicine,

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.579
you must also know how to poison someone.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.290
What did you say?

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.450
Chen Jingbian is hosting a dinner.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.079
That's a miracle.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.210
It's not even a holiday.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.880
What is he up to?

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.040
I think something's fishy.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.700
Maybe we should just decline.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.340
Why should we be afraid of him?

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.360
I want to see what this old eunuch

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.040
is really planning.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.490
Tomorrow I'll host a banquet at my residence.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.400
Wei Cheng will be invited.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.240
Didn't you want revenge against him?

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.340
I'm giving you this opportunity.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.780
Master.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.160
I've never poisoned anyone before.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.620
This...

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.200
I don't know how to do it.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.860
This wine pot has a mechanism.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.480
Just turn the lid to release the poison.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.200
It seems this vendetta

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.880
was just empty talk.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.920
Where is your determination now?

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.280
Or perhaps from the beginning,

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.340
you've been playing me for a fool.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.640
I...

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.320
Thank you, Lord Chen,

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.720
for your great kindness.

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:57.680
You're thanking me too soon.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.160
Jing Ke's assassination of the King of Qin,

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.420
Zhuan Zhu's assassination of King Liao,

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.780
have you heard of them?

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.640
Yes, I have.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.120
If tomorrow's plan succeeds,

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.440
you'll be like Zhuan Zhu.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.000
If it fails,

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.360
you'll be like Jing Ke.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.720
Whether you succeed or fail,

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.480
at least you will have tried your best.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.360
Then you can peacefully go to the underworld

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.160
and reunite with your family.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.720
I won't be a burden to you, Master.

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:35.490
When the time comes, you won't need to act.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.320
I will end my own life.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.800
It seems I haven't wasted my affection on you.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:56.280
What?

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.640
Poisoning Wei Cheng?

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.360
Keep your voice down.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.760
Don't let others hear us.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.930
Did you hear it clearly?

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.570
I heard Lord Chen instructing Nongyu myself.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.250
This Nongyu, just to please Lord Chen,

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.000
would go this far.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.600
It's not just to please him.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.160
I heard Lord Chen say Wei Cheng killed Nongyu's entire family.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.600
Killed her entire family?

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.780
That old eunuch is probably ready to bring everyone down with him.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.680
If I go inform Wei Cheng now,

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.659
wouldn't that be a great achievement for me?

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.450
Sister Pang,

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.200
haven't you had enough of living like this?

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:52.880
I hate Chen Jingbian.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.330
He's made my life worse than death.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.980
But I hate Wei Cheng even more.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.280
What he did to you

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.920
was worse than an animal.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.720
Sister Pang, promise me.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.540
Don't go to Wei Cheng, please.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.900
I can't bear to see you degrading yourself anymore.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.640
Then what should I do?

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.000
Resist?

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.160
I come from Pingkang District.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.690
What do I have to fight with?

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.960
Besides,

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.920
my son Rui is still in his hands.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.240
Have you thought about

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.820
what happens if Nongyu succeeds?

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:48.520
Master.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.360
This Wei Cheng is getting too bold.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:53.920
Wait.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.240
Prefect Wei has arrived.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.400
Lord Chen,

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:09.520
I'm late.

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:10.820
Please forgive me.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:12.960
Play the music.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.330
I thought you looked familiar.

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:38.960
Now I remember.

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:40.840
I've seen you before.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.400
I heard that Lord Chen

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.480
has a new female physician in his household.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.410
That must be you.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.000
In response to Lord Wei,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:48.880
yes, it is me.

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.080
I had no idea before

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:57.800
that such a beauty could be a skilled doctor.

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.720
When you help Lord Chen solve his problems,

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.960
you're also helping me, Wei Cheng.

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:06.920
Come,

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:08.440
drink this cup.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:12.120
Consider it my token of gratitude.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.460
You insolent servant!

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.460
You don't know your place.

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.780
How dare a concubine pour wine for an honored guest?

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.120
Yuyao.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:48.800
Mr. Chen,

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.560
what does this mean?

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:53.240
Don't you like it anymore?

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.560
If you don't, you can give it to me.

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:00.240
I know my mistake.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.240
Let me try again.

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:14.760
You must be tired.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:15.560
Let me do it.

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.720
Pouring wine is something I should do.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:22.480
Report!

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.320
Sir Chen,

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.120
an urgent confidential report.

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:31.760
Everyone leave.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:36.480
Speak.

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:39.080
Prince Jin An Qingxu has plotted to kill An Lushan.

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.520
He's claiming that An died of sudden illness.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.250
And forged a decree to make himself crown prince.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.290
What did you say?

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.760
An Qingxu killed An Lushan.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.280
Mr. Chen,

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.600
is this information reliable?

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.000
Since I have the Night Firefly Map here,

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.730
do you think the information is reliable?

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:14.020
Urgent report!

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.640
If it's urgent, report it now.

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:20.000
Yes.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.600
Emperor An Lushan of Great Yan has passed away.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:27.200
Continue.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:28.760
That's all.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:32.280
What?

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.120
That's it?

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:33.600
Sir.

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.680
That's it. Really nothing more.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.920
What's the point of keeping useless people like you?

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:41.080
You call this intelligence?

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:41.720
Get out!

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:42.960
Yes, yes, yes.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:50.240
General Wei.

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:54.240
I offer you my congratulations.

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.120
Now that An Lushan is dead.

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.360
My patron has fallen.

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:05.040
But you, General Wei, grew up with An Qingxu.

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.560
Like brothers.

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:10.120
If Lord An ascends to the throne one day,

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:14.000
wouldn't you become his most trusted minister?

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:18.160
I will need to rely on your support in the future.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Trying to fool me.

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.960
That old fox is using Wei Cheng's humiliation to test me.

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:31.290
I've already tested it.

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.380
There's no poison in that wine at all.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.800
I'll need to be more careful from now on.

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:38.960
After Sister Yu,

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:40.600
I've met another miracle doctor.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:41.530
Miracle doctor?

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:46.770
How miraculous?

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:48.600
Well, he's quite amazing.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.800
But he's just an old man,

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:52.130
invited by the Tang camp in our Liangzhou.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:53.520
Qi,

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:57.400
is this longgu from that miracle doctor?
