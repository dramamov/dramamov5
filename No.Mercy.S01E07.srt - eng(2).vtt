(Mom)

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:50.050
(No Mercy)

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:53.053
(All characters, organizations, groups,)

(and events in this drama are fictitious.)

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.193
(Episode 7)

00:01:24.618 --> 00:01:25.586
You're here?

00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:28.455
What happened? Are you okay?

00:01:28.455 --> 00:01:29.323
I'm fine.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:33.794
So Min.

00:01:34.795 --> 00:01:36.496
Do you remember what I said?

00:01:37.231 --> 00:01:41.268
Everyone seems to have
their own right path.

00:01:48.075 --> 00:01:49.743
What are you doing?

00:01:54.081 --> 00:01:54.982
Sorry.

00:01:55.616 --> 00:01:56.617
This is my path.

00:01:57.951 --> 00:01:59.453
Since when?

00:02:14.935 --> 00:02:17.538
(VOICE CHANGER)

00:02:20.407 --> 00:02:21.375
Damn it.

00:02:21.375 --> 00:02:22.476
It's me.

00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:25.412
Yoo Seung caught Wei Chang Yu.

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:27.748
I'll send you the address.
Go take care of it.

00:02:38.725 --> 00:02:39.626
All right then.

00:02:40.794 --> 00:02:41.728
Good luck.

00:02:44.031 --> 00:02:45.199
You son of a bitch!

00:03:03.984 --> 00:03:05.719
We're going to be late. Let's go.

00:03:25.772 --> 00:03:26.874
Damn it.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.227
Let's go inside.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:51.465
You little bastard.

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:54.168
You bastard.

00:03:55.502 --> 00:03:57.271
You son of a bitch.

00:03:57.271 --> 00:03:58.138
Chairman.

00:04:07.614 --> 00:04:08.582
We're back, sir.

00:04:09.583 --> 00:04:11.151
You're back earlier than I expected.

00:04:11.151 --> 00:04:13.320
I retrieved the slush fund
you mentioned, sir.

00:04:19.226 --> 00:04:21.895
There was no good cover to bring it back.

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:24.031
But you found it just as planned.

00:04:25.032 --> 00:04:26.166
Good job.

00:04:26.633 --> 00:04:27.568
Thank you, sir.

00:04:27.835 --> 00:04:29.536
You filthy bastards.

00:04:30.571 --> 00:04:32.105
Well, well.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.043
You still have some energy left to talk,
huh, Seok Gu?

00:04:37.077 --> 00:04:39.413
I'm so sorry, sir. Please forgive me.

00:04:39.413 --> 00:04:40.280
I've done...

00:04:41.448 --> 00:04:42.950
something unforgivable.

00:04:44.751 --> 00:04:47.721
It'll never happen again.

00:04:47.721 --> 00:04:48.689
I'm really sorry.

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:50.457
Go ahead then, talk.

00:04:51.425 --> 00:04:52.292
Sorry?

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:56.330
"Don't kill me, sir."

00:04:57.531 --> 00:04:59.633
Beg for your life.

00:05:02.402 --> 00:05:04.404
Who knows?

00:05:04.404 --> 00:05:05.906
I might change my mind.

00:05:06.907 --> 00:05:07.608
Woof.

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:09.643
Woof.

00:05:10.611 --> 00:05:12.145
Bark like a dog.

00:05:17.584 --> 00:05:19.987
This is why I hate keeping dogs.

00:05:20.921 --> 00:05:22.856
They never listen when you talk nicely.

00:05:28.061 --> 00:05:29.162
Forget it.

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:34.501
Now you know...

00:05:35.435 --> 00:05:39.406
who owns you, don't you?

00:05:40.741 --> 00:05:44.211
You should always know your place.

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:47.214
Thank you, Chairman.

00:05:48.782 --> 00:05:50.450
Just give me any order.

00:05:52.052 --> 00:05:53.287
I'll do whatever you command.

00:05:54.221 --> 00:05:55.155
Thank you, sir.

00:06:19.112 --> 00:06:20.814
(No Mercy)

00:06:31.258 --> 00:06:32.726
Ugh, crap.

00:07:05.726 --> 00:07:07.160
Hey, hit them.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.028
Yes, sir.

00:07:37.858 --> 00:07:39.726
I've dealt with all of Ma's men.

00:07:39.893 --> 00:07:41.428
Bring that girl too, on your way back.

00:07:42.095 --> 00:07:42.930
Yes, sir.

00:07:45.999 --> 00:07:47.167
Bring her back alive.

00:07:47.534 --> 00:07:48.969
The Chairman wants to
take care of her himself.

00:07:49.236 --> 00:07:50.237
Yes, understood.

00:07:52.706 --> 00:07:53.407
Let's go.

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:57.845
This is fun.

00:08:02.883 --> 00:08:04.718
Where's my darling?

00:08:04.718 --> 00:08:06.019
Where is he?

00:08:06.386 --> 00:08:07.888
Where is he?

00:08:08.755 --> 00:08:09.590
Do Jin.

00:08:10.023 --> 00:08:10.891
Over here.

00:08:21.401 --> 00:08:22.369
Well, that's a first.

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.072
I'm usually the one being cuffed,
not uncuffing people.

00:08:26.273 --> 00:08:27.674
How'd you know I was here?

00:08:27.674 --> 00:08:28.609
What?

00:08:29.009 --> 00:08:31.979
I had no idea you were here.

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:35.616
I just saw this was
his last known location.

00:08:35.616 --> 00:08:37.518
You said you lost his signal back then.

00:08:37.684 --> 00:08:40.087
Even if you lose the signal,
it'll reconnect if it's meant to.

00:08:40.587 --> 00:08:43.223
I saw him log into the app,
so I rushed over.

00:08:43.223 --> 00:08:44.558
But it's gone now.

00:08:46.793 --> 00:08:49.029
Every time I get close,
he pulls further away.

00:08:49.563 --> 00:08:50.664
Did you know?

00:08:51.231 --> 00:08:52.633
About what?

00:08:52.966 --> 00:08:55.702
That Park Jeong Hun is working
with the Ilseong clan?

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:57.037
What?

00:08:58.805 --> 00:08:59.706
Who said that?

00:09:00.474 --> 00:09:01.208
Some rumor?

00:09:01.208 --> 00:09:03.076
You see what happened here?

00:09:03.544 --> 00:09:06.013
That bastard lured me here
and stole my money.

00:09:09.449 --> 00:09:11.485
If that's the case, it's no fun.

00:09:12.085 --> 00:09:13.287
No, that can't happen.

00:09:13.287 --> 00:09:15.656
Ilseong guys can't find out I'm here.

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:17.925
- Drag her out now.
- Oh no.

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:21.728
Do Jin.

00:09:22.729 --> 00:09:23.697
How did you get here?

00:09:23.697 --> 00:09:25.632
Taxi.

00:09:25.866 --> 00:09:27.568
- You don't have a driver's license?
- I have one but never use it.

00:09:28.035 --> 00:09:29.102
Damn it.

00:09:34.975 --> 00:09:35.809
Don't move.

00:09:37.211 --> 00:09:38.378
Don't test me.

00:09:39.546 --> 00:09:40.447
I'll blow us all up.

00:09:41.181 --> 00:09:42.749
- Damn it.
- Go ahead.

00:09:43.483 --> 00:09:45.619
Don't move or I'll do it.

00:09:47.054 --> 00:09:48.488
- Damn it.
- Go ahead.

00:09:48.488 --> 00:09:49.389
Go ahead.

00:09:51.558 --> 00:09:52.593
Get her!

00:10:05.572 --> 00:10:06.373
Get her!

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:14.715
Get her!

00:10:55.088 --> 00:10:56.290
Hello, sir.

00:10:58.091 --> 00:10:59.259
Who the hell are you?

00:11:02.396 --> 00:11:04.097
Did you just hit him with that?

00:11:04.097 --> 00:11:05.332
- Damn it.
- You did.

00:11:05.332 --> 00:11:06.300
Get in the car.

00:11:07.701 --> 00:11:08.836
I said get in, now.

00:11:08.836 --> 00:11:09.636
Okay.

00:11:18.078 --> 00:11:19.079
You have a license?

00:11:19.346 --> 00:11:20.647
- I have one, but I've never used it.
- Crap.

00:11:35.762 --> 00:11:37.798
Last time,

00:11:37.798 --> 00:11:40.400
I told you to catch the one
who took my money.

00:11:41.268 --> 00:11:43.604
Why haven't I gotten any updates?

00:11:43.604 --> 00:11:44.671
Well...

00:11:45.138 --> 00:11:48.509
We're looking everywhere for them.

00:11:51.578 --> 00:11:54.681
I thought you'd have found them by now.

00:11:55.749 --> 00:11:56.783
Am I wrong?

00:11:58.185 --> 00:11:59.086
Sorry?

00:12:00.053 --> 00:12:01.889
What do you mean?

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:06.126
Your son's quite something, Commissioner.

00:12:07.628 --> 00:12:08.662
Did you know...

00:12:09.363 --> 00:12:13.033
he's been working for me since last year?

00:12:14.568 --> 00:12:15.435
What?

00:12:17.204 --> 00:12:18.205
Chairman.

00:12:19.039 --> 00:12:21.842
What exactly do you mean?

00:12:22.876 --> 00:12:26.613
He just recovered my slush fund.

00:12:26.914 --> 00:12:29.016
Now he's completely become my man.

00:12:32.886 --> 00:12:35.189
You wanted campaign funding, right?

00:12:35.722 --> 00:12:36.757
Then...

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:40.427
show me you're better than your son.

00:12:40.928 --> 00:12:41.728
What?

00:12:41.728 --> 00:12:46.066
We'll talk about the funding later.

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.769
Sir,

00:12:49.803 --> 00:12:52.372
you'll pit father against son?

00:12:52.372 --> 00:12:54.208
How is that even possible?

00:12:54.641 --> 00:12:57.511
With your experience and reputation,

00:12:57.511 --> 00:13:01.215
you can't let some young punk
get the better of you, right?

00:13:01.849 --> 00:13:04.384
You've got your dignity
as Police Commissioner.

00:13:07.654 --> 00:13:09.790
Speaking of which,
I've got a little favor.

00:13:11.525 --> 00:13:13.260
One of my dogs...

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.096
has been making a mess everywhere.

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:18.866
I'd like you to clean it up for me.

00:13:40.954 --> 00:13:42.422
Did you have to do that?

00:13:42.756 --> 00:13:45.058
You're the one who took Mom...

00:13:45.058 --> 00:13:46.326
from me first.

00:13:46.326 --> 00:13:49.196
Your mom was mentally ill.

00:13:49.196 --> 00:13:52.065
If you couldn't be there for her,
you shouldn't have hurt her.

00:13:52.566 --> 00:13:53.400
What?

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.870
She might have meant nothing to you,

00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:58.071
but to me,

00:14:00.807 --> 00:14:03.110
she was my whole world.

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:04.745
It's all in the past.

00:14:07.114 --> 00:14:09.183
You threw everything away for that?

00:14:09.183 --> 00:14:10.784
You pathetic fool.

00:14:12.286 --> 00:14:14.521
I'll show you how pathetic...

00:14:14.521 --> 00:14:15.589
I can be.

00:14:21.562 --> 00:14:22.863
Are you ready?

00:14:25.465 --> 00:14:27.501
If you stand in my way,

00:14:29.069 --> 00:14:31.138
I won't spare you,
even if you're my own son.

00:14:31.638 --> 00:14:32.706
I look forward to it.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:34.074
Well, then.

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.481
I've got a car waiting up front, sir.

00:14:41.915 --> 00:14:42.883
All right, let's go.

00:14:54.161 --> 00:14:55.195
It's me.

00:14:55.729 --> 00:14:58.565
Tell them to call off the arrest operation
on Ma Seok Gu.

00:15:05.806 --> 00:15:07.007
Sir.

00:15:07.741 --> 00:15:11.678
I've farmed this land my entire life.

00:15:11.678 --> 00:15:13.080
Compensation?

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.715
I don't need any.

00:15:15.115 --> 00:15:18.685
Just let me keep farming it.

00:15:18.685 --> 00:15:20.721
Please, sir.

00:15:21.255 --> 00:15:24.024
Yes, I understand.

00:15:24.024 --> 00:15:26.994
Come back next week
and bring it up again at the meeting.

00:15:26.994 --> 00:15:27.995
Show him out.

00:15:28.362 --> 00:15:29.296
Yes.

00:15:35.903 --> 00:15:36.937
Detective Park?

00:15:39.473 --> 00:15:42.442
Hope we're not interrupting.

00:15:43.577 --> 00:15:45.445
What brings you two here?

00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:47.080
Please, have a seat.

00:15:47.514 --> 00:15:48.415
Sure.

00:15:48.782 --> 00:15:50.417
Thank you.

00:15:53.086 --> 00:15:55.455
It's really nice out.

00:15:57.057 --> 00:15:59.960
What brings you here all of a sudden?

00:16:01.328 --> 00:16:03.330
I heard the tourism promotion bill...

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:05.299
has passed the committee.

00:16:05.299 --> 00:16:08.001
As party leader,

00:16:08.001 --> 00:16:09.837
I surely have the power to manage that.

00:16:11.772 --> 00:16:12.806
Thank you.

00:16:13.106 --> 00:16:15.275
I know how much work you've put in.

00:16:16.243 --> 00:16:20.447
So the land development issue is
settled then?

00:16:20.447 --> 00:16:21.348
Now...

00:16:22.216 --> 00:16:24.785
the key is selecting a private developer.

00:16:26.954 --> 00:16:30.390
That might be tricky.

00:16:32.492 --> 00:16:35.495
I represent the people.

00:16:35.729 --> 00:16:38.465
Shouldn't I be working for them,

00:16:38.932 --> 00:16:40.767
not for personal gain?

00:16:46.874 --> 00:16:50.377
I heard your son gave up
his US citizenship...

00:16:50.377 --> 00:16:51.945
and joined the military.

00:16:52.513 --> 00:16:54.715
That's very admirable.

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:02.022
I've got a phone call.

00:17:02.656 --> 00:17:05.292
I'll step outside and leave you two
to talk comfortably.

00:17:11.665 --> 00:17:14.935
Sir, you know what I mean.

00:17:15.602 --> 00:17:18.438
I was speaking figuratively.

00:17:19.039 --> 00:17:22.376
Even with the drugs and hit-and-run death,

00:17:22.376 --> 00:17:23.810
the media has been silent.

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:26.380
You know better than anyone why.

00:17:27.014 --> 00:17:29.483
Well, the thing is...

00:17:29.483 --> 00:17:31.685
You're in that seat...

00:17:32.219 --> 00:17:33.787
because I put...

00:17:34.221 --> 00:17:35.589
personal interests...

00:17:35.589 --> 00:17:38.525
over the public good, isn't that right?

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:44.998
Yes.

00:17:44.998 --> 00:17:46.533
You're right.

00:17:47.668 --> 00:17:49.970
I'm always grateful.

00:17:56.443 --> 00:17:57.477
Tell me the truth.

00:17:58.579 --> 00:18:00.013
You had your own agenda
when you joined, didn't you?

00:18:01.181 --> 00:18:02.516
Of course not.

00:18:03.083 --> 00:18:05.385
Are you really jealous...

00:18:05.686 --> 00:18:06.887
that I took the seat you wanted?

00:18:13.026 --> 00:18:13.927
That's why...

00:18:14.494 --> 00:18:16.029
you shouldn't trust people so easily.

00:18:16.964 --> 00:18:18.699
You should be scamming,

00:18:18.699 --> 00:18:20.434
not getting scammed.

00:18:21.101 --> 00:18:23.337
Who do you think you are?

00:18:24.404 --> 00:18:26.673
You're really testing me, aren't you?

00:18:32.246 --> 00:18:34.615
Nice hands. It'd be a shame
if something happened to them.

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:38.418
Watch yourself,

00:18:38.852 --> 00:18:39.686
mister.

00:18:48.028 --> 00:18:49.796
That bastard.

00:18:55.035 --> 00:18:57.204
Seok Gu, no, Jeong Hun.

00:18:58.138 --> 00:18:59.106
Yes, sir.

00:18:59.806 --> 00:19:01.208
Do you know where this is?

00:19:02.943 --> 00:19:05.445
Isn't this the resort site
you'll be developing?

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:07.981
Wrong.

00:19:09.016 --> 00:19:10.951
This isn't just any resort.

00:19:12.186 --> 00:19:13.253
It's a miracle.

00:19:14.555 --> 00:19:17.024
The kind that will make me...

00:19:17.791 --> 00:19:19.126
a world-class CEO.

00:19:20.127 --> 00:19:22.429
So we just need investors now?

00:19:22.863 --> 00:19:24.264
That's the tricky part.

00:19:24.731 --> 00:19:28.468
We don't have anything
to make investors bite.

00:19:29.803 --> 00:19:31.238
We have Congressman Seo.

00:19:31.638 --> 00:19:33.106
One isn't enough.

00:19:33.607 --> 00:19:36.577
We need a face for the company.

00:19:38.979 --> 00:19:40.013
Then...

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.783
what if we created one?

00:19:53.827 --> 00:19:55.395
So you're saying...

00:19:56.063 --> 00:19:59.166
we should use a deep-fake model
for promotion?

00:20:00.167 --> 00:20:03.437
For private equity investors?

00:20:04.605 --> 00:20:05.539
Correct.

00:20:06.206 --> 00:20:09.443
We'll put political heavyweights in front.

00:20:11.011 --> 00:20:14.047
Once we pump up the value and cash out,

00:20:14.047 --> 00:20:15.782
the returns will be massive.

00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:19.119
If they knew, who would report it?

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:21.655
In the end, they'll be in the same boat.

00:20:22.956 --> 00:20:23.891
Would...

00:20:25.125 --> 00:20:26.293
three days be enough?

00:20:27.494 --> 00:20:28.395
Yes, sir.

00:20:30.063 --> 00:20:30.998
You're here.

00:20:31.164 --> 00:20:32.900
Any word on the woman who got away?

00:20:33.867 --> 00:20:36.303
We've looked all over,

00:20:36.303 --> 00:20:37.471
but nothing yet.

00:20:39.806 --> 00:20:41.542
With all our guys here,

00:20:41.542 --> 00:20:44.311
how is it possible we can't catch a girl?

00:20:44.578 --> 00:20:45.612
My apologies, sir.

00:20:48.148 --> 00:20:49.049
Chairman.

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:51.218
I'll make sure to catch her myself.

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:53.787
Go on.

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:04.331
Chairman.

00:21:04.831 --> 00:21:07.401
I know this might be overstepping,
but can I ask you one thing?

00:21:07.401 --> 00:21:09.102
If you know you're overstepping, why ask?

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:13.006
I'm not trying to impress you,

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:15.876
I'm genuinely worried about you.

00:21:16.977 --> 00:21:19.346
Why do you keep that guy around?

00:21:19.346 --> 00:21:21.682
It's complicated, so just drop it
before I lose my patience.

00:21:21.682 --> 00:21:23.517
You barely know him.

00:21:23.517 --> 00:21:25.118
And you really trust him?

00:21:26.086 --> 00:21:28.655
I've served you for twenty years.

00:21:28.655 --> 00:21:29.990
But you won't hear me out.

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:32.626
You think I trust him?

00:21:35.095 --> 00:21:35.929
Sorry?

00:21:38.065 --> 00:21:40.801
There's nothing as foolish as
trusting people.

00:21:41.602 --> 00:21:43.770
They always show
their true colors eventually.

00:21:44.972 --> 00:21:46.373
In this situation,

00:21:46.373 --> 00:21:48.809
who do you think is playing into a trap?

00:21:49.109 --> 00:21:50.110
Me?

00:21:50.377 --> 00:21:51.311
Him?

00:21:52.346 --> 00:21:53.547
Or you?

00:21:55.315 --> 00:21:58.218
I only see the results people show.

00:21:59.086 --> 00:22:01.421
If you want to speak, show me.

00:22:08.896 --> 00:22:09.730
Yes, sir.

00:22:24.178 --> 00:22:25.646
Why can't they make up their minds?

00:22:25.646 --> 00:22:28.115
If they're going to keep changing their
minds, they can catch him themselves.

00:22:29.716 --> 00:22:31.618
Chief, is everything okay?

00:22:32.519 --> 00:22:35.122
They told us to stop going after
Ma Seok Gu now.

00:22:35.622 --> 00:22:37.824
Last time they told us to catch him
as soon as possible.

00:22:37.824 --> 00:22:39.526
That's exactly my point.

00:22:39.526 --> 00:22:40.827
They told us to catch him, then not to.

00:22:40.827 --> 00:22:42.296
We've got almost
all the security camera footage.

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:45.766
We just need to trace the final route.

00:22:46.767 --> 00:22:49.136
This is really driving me crazy.

00:22:53.473 --> 00:22:56.677
Lee Jong Chan, voice phishing unit,
Seongan Police.

00:22:57.211 --> 00:22:58.045
Yes.

00:22:59.313 --> 00:23:00.147
What?

00:23:01.448 --> 00:23:02.516
Understood.

00:23:03.851 --> 00:23:05.319
What's wrong?

00:23:06.653 --> 00:23:08.889
The investigative unit handed us a case.

00:23:10.357 --> 00:23:12.926
The suspect is...

00:23:28.742 --> 00:23:31.111
I can't go home or use my phone for days.

00:23:31.845 --> 00:23:33.347
What on earth is going on?

00:23:39.853 --> 00:23:43.824
Can I just check my phone real quick?

00:23:51.565 --> 00:23:53.133
(Phone powering on)

00:23:57.037 --> 00:23:59.239
You're pretty popular, So Min.

00:24:01.008 --> 00:24:02.576
(16 unread messages)

00:24:06.413 --> 00:24:09.416
(Ms. Ha So Min has been named a suspect
and must come in for questioning.)

00:24:12.553 --> 00:24:14.488
I didn't see that coming.

00:24:17.224 --> 00:24:19.126
(Hye Dam - missed call)

00:24:22.429 --> 00:24:24.631
- Hye Dam.
- So Min, where have you been?

00:24:24.631 --> 00:24:26.099
Why haven't you been answering?

00:24:26.099 --> 00:24:27.100
Let's meet.

00:24:28.135 --> 00:24:29.169
I need to see you and talk.

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:35.943
You received a video call,

00:24:36.143 --> 00:24:37.377
and it was me calling?

00:24:37.845 --> 00:24:38.712
Yeah.

00:24:41.582 --> 00:24:43.884
So Min, what's going on?

00:24:43.884 --> 00:24:44.952
Where are you?

00:24:45.552 --> 00:24:46.553
I'm in China.

00:24:47.054 --> 00:24:47.855
What?

00:24:48.589 --> 00:24:49.823
Why are you there?

00:24:50.057 --> 00:24:51.959
They promised good money,

00:24:51.959 --> 00:24:53.327
but it's a voice-phishing operation.

00:24:53.961 --> 00:24:54.928
What do I do?

00:24:55.662 --> 00:24:58.932
Just prepare a copy of your ID.

00:24:59.466 --> 00:25:02.035
Then we'll guide you through the process.

00:25:02.736 --> 00:25:03.604
Wait.

00:25:04.438 --> 00:25:05.606
You're Ha So Min, right?

00:25:06.974 --> 00:25:09.276
Hey, are you okay?

00:25:09.276 --> 00:25:10.210
Yeah, for now.

00:25:10.978 --> 00:25:13.313
They killed someone yesterday
for trying to escape.

00:25:13.313 --> 00:25:15.749
They're saying I have to pay
if I want to get out alive.

00:25:15.749 --> 00:25:16.483
What should I do?

00:25:17.918 --> 00:25:19.086
How much are they asking for?

00:25:19.653 --> 00:25:20.654
$30,000.

00:25:21.922 --> 00:25:24.992
Hye Dam, I hate to ask,

00:25:24.992 --> 00:25:26.026
but can you help me?

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:27.594
Hey.

00:25:28.195 --> 00:25:30.364
I don't have that kind of money.

00:25:31.899 --> 00:25:33.100
Someone's coming. I have to hang up.

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:34.535
If I get caught, I'm screwed.

00:25:35.102 --> 00:25:37.771
Hye Dam, please do me this favor.

00:25:37.771 --> 00:25:39.773
I'll pay you back once I'm back in Korea.

00:25:39.773 --> 00:25:41.041
Where should I send the money?

00:25:43.677 --> 00:25:45.212
You know what the reply was?

00:25:50.651 --> 00:25:52.186
"So Min, I sent the money."

00:25:52.186 --> 00:25:53.420
Can you get out right away?

00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:54.755
(Sorry, but you just got scammed.)

00:25:54.755 --> 00:25:56.123
(You can't trust anyone in this business.)

00:25:57.324 --> 00:25:58.825
Who the hell was that?

00:26:01.028 --> 00:26:02.229
Hey, Wei Chang Yu.

00:26:02.796 --> 00:26:04.231
How's it going?

00:26:04.231 --> 00:26:07.134
This is why you can't trust anyone
in this business. Damn it.

00:26:17.878 --> 00:26:19.680
Where's Park Jeong Hun now?

00:26:20.247 --> 00:26:22.916
With Chairman Kim, most likely.

00:26:22.916 --> 00:26:24.751
And where can I find that bastard?

00:26:25.586 --> 00:26:27.054
I'm not sure about that.

00:26:30.557 --> 00:26:31.758
Scissors.

00:26:32.759 --> 00:26:34.528
Scissors, scissors, rock.

00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:37.898
Turn off your phone.

00:26:38.765 --> 00:26:40.934
The cops are tracking us.

00:27:19.573 --> 00:27:21.775
(Hearin Real Estate)

00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:25.312
What are you talking about?

00:27:25.712 --> 00:27:27.648
You're going to get yourself in
serious trouble.

00:27:28.549 --> 00:27:32.419
The property was leased to Ahn, not Kim.

00:27:32.419 --> 00:27:34.221
The names don't even match.

00:27:34.221 --> 00:27:35.722
Look,

00:27:35.722 --> 00:27:37.257
if I were shady,

00:27:37.257 --> 00:27:39.493
would I have my business...

00:27:40.227 --> 00:27:43.430
right here in this neighborhood?

00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:46.400
I've been here for 20 years.

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:55.843
(Real estate contract)

00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:57.778
Check the back.

00:27:58.145 --> 00:28:00.347
There's evidence of pyramid schemes.

00:28:03.016 --> 00:28:05.786
Feel like you got screwed?
Should I tell the cops...

00:28:06.253 --> 00:28:07.754
that Kim set you up?

00:28:12.426 --> 00:28:13.493
What do you think?

00:28:15.062 --> 00:28:17.097
Yeah, looks good.

00:28:17.097 --> 00:28:18.999
Everything I asked for is done.

00:28:19.499 --> 00:28:22.402
Soundproofing, ventilation,

00:28:22.402 --> 00:28:24.972
and power, everything is solid.

00:28:24.972 --> 00:28:28.509
Security cameras only cover this side.

00:28:28.876 --> 00:28:29.776
Sir,

00:28:30.077 --> 00:28:32.613
I'm paying you well.
This better be secure.

00:28:32.613 --> 00:28:35.749
Absolutely.
You've got nothing to worry about.

00:28:35.749 --> 00:28:37.584
As you can see,

00:28:37.584 --> 00:28:40.387
it's a quiet area.

00:28:41.121 --> 00:28:42.122
Also,

00:28:42.122 --> 00:28:45.259
you know the VIP room
costs extra if needed.

00:28:45.259 --> 00:28:49.496
The cops won't be a problem.
I've got them handled.

00:28:51.098 --> 00:28:54.201
Mr. Kim and Ma Seok Gu go way back.

00:28:54.201 --> 00:28:56.170
They're thick as thieves.

00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:58.805
But word is Chairman Kim's the one...

00:28:58.805 --> 00:29:00.274
who landed him the captain's spot.

00:29:01.875 --> 00:29:03.677
I'm counting on you.

00:29:03.677 --> 00:29:05.512
Right back at you.

00:29:06.613 --> 00:29:07.514
I don't need to count it, right?

00:29:07.514 --> 00:29:08.849
Please. We're professionals.

00:29:08.849 --> 00:29:10.684
To honesty and transparency.

00:29:10.684 --> 00:29:11.585
Cheers to that.

00:29:18.892 --> 00:29:19.826
Mr. Kim.

00:29:23.697 --> 00:29:25.532
Did you miss me?

00:29:25.766 --> 00:29:27.267
Wei Chang Yu?

00:29:28.168 --> 00:29:30.103
What are you doing here?

00:29:30.103 --> 00:29:31.138
Ma Seok Gu,

00:29:31.471 --> 00:29:32.439
forget about him.

00:29:32.806 --> 00:29:34.074
The guy he works for.

00:29:35.108 --> 00:29:36.376
Where is he?

00:29:36.376 --> 00:29:38.312
You show up out of nowhere...

00:29:38.312 --> 00:29:40.747
with this crap?

00:29:41.849 --> 00:29:44.084
Does Ma Seok Gu know...

00:29:45.853 --> 00:29:46.887
you're hiding out here?

00:29:48.555 --> 00:29:49.456
What?

00:29:49.656 --> 00:29:51.124
Answer me,

00:29:52.526 --> 00:29:53.760
or everyone finds out
what you've been doing.

00:30:03.337 --> 00:30:04.972
Good to see you, sir.

00:30:05.439 --> 00:30:07.174
Hope the drive wasn't too bad.

00:30:07.641 --> 00:30:09.543
Thanks for sending the car.

00:30:09.543 --> 00:30:10.744
It made it easy.

00:30:12.713 --> 00:30:14.248
Nice to meet you, sir.

00:30:14.248 --> 00:30:15.983
I'm Park Jeong Hun, we spoke before.

00:30:17.384 --> 00:30:19.086
- Good to finally meet in person.
- Nice to see you too.

00:30:23.857 --> 00:30:26.627
You sure you don't need me to come?

00:30:26.627 --> 00:30:28.695
Stay here and watch.

00:30:29.062 --> 00:30:30.030
If something happens,

00:30:30.931 --> 00:30:32.232
knock twice.

00:30:32.466 --> 00:30:33.600
Don't say a word.

00:30:34.668 --> 00:30:36.470
But what if Detective Park
really is working with them...

00:30:38.605 --> 00:30:40.274
If I'm not back in an hour,

00:30:40.274 --> 00:30:41.508
call the police.

00:30:41.508 --> 00:30:42.442
Okay.

00:30:54.188 --> 00:30:56.523
Let me show you...

00:30:56.523 --> 00:30:59.760
how much of
Seongan's main development area...

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:00.994
the Gyumin Construction project covers.

00:31:00.994 --> 00:31:01.828
Okay.

00:31:11.038 --> 00:31:14.541
So it's basically done.

00:31:15.075 --> 00:31:15.976
By the way,

00:31:16.743 --> 00:31:19.947
are these investors the people
I think they are?

00:31:19.947 --> 00:31:20.781
Which ones?

00:31:21.949 --> 00:31:23.951
(Potential investor list)
(Seo Jung Geun)

00:31:24.318 --> 00:31:26.353
You mean Congressman Seo Jung Geun?

00:31:30.224 --> 00:31:31.959
My goodness.

00:31:33.193 --> 00:31:36.363
Sorry I'm late. I had to finish
my work at the Assembly.

00:31:37.397 --> 00:31:38.165
Nice to meet you.

00:31:39.867 --> 00:31:40.868
Oh boy.

00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:44.505
How have you been, Chairman?

00:31:44.505 --> 00:31:46.540
You're right on time.

00:32:15.235 --> 00:32:16.937
Then this must be...

00:32:16.937 --> 00:32:17.738
(Park Jae Gyu)

00:32:17.738 --> 00:32:20.741
The Commissioner couldn't make it...

00:32:20.741 --> 00:32:22.676
since he's at a briefing.

00:32:22.676 --> 00:32:26.146
His son's here instead. You can trust him.

00:32:26.146 --> 00:32:27.681
I see.

00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:31.585
It's too soon to be surprised, sir.

00:32:34.421 --> 00:32:36.089
This project...

00:32:36.089 --> 00:32:38.659
isn't just construction.

00:32:38.659 --> 00:32:42.095
We're turning Seongan into
a global tourism hub...

00:32:42.095 --> 00:32:44.264
that'll put Korea on the map.

00:32:44.264 --> 00:32:46.500
I'm Lee Myung Gi, former Minister of Land.

00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:48.235
Gyumin Tourism Construction...

00:32:48.235 --> 00:32:50.938
will lead Korea's tourism industry
into the future.

00:32:51.238 --> 00:32:54.808
They're all investing?

00:32:55.142 --> 00:32:58.011
That shows the company's value...

00:32:58.345 --> 00:33:00.581
and credibility, doesn't it?

00:33:02.182 --> 00:33:03.183
I agree.

00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:05.719
The government is fully behind this...

00:33:05.719 --> 00:33:07.154
Sorry, excuse me a moment.

00:33:07.888 --> 00:33:08.755
Sure.

00:33:39.319 --> 00:33:40.354
What are you doing?

00:33:45.526 --> 00:33:48.095
I guess I'm nervous.
I needed to use the restroom.

00:33:51.198 --> 00:33:53.834
Chairman wants you. Let's go.

00:33:53.834 --> 00:33:55.669
Sure.

00:33:57.437 --> 00:33:58.705
What've you got there?

00:34:00.674 --> 00:34:02.176
He told me not to tell anyone.

00:34:02.609 --> 00:34:03.544
Sorry, I can't tell you.

00:34:04.444 --> 00:34:05.345
Let's go.

00:34:06.647 --> 00:34:07.481
Sure.

00:34:23.764 --> 00:34:24.898
Everything okay?

00:34:30.437 --> 00:34:31.905
This all sounds good,
but I have a question.

00:34:31.905 --> 00:34:33.273
Please, go ahead.

00:34:33.907 --> 00:34:36.777
Casino regulations in Korea are strict.

00:34:37.444 --> 00:34:38.745
Isn't it risky...

00:34:39.313 --> 00:34:40.848
trying to ease regulations...

00:34:41.281 --> 00:34:42.516
and get approval?

00:34:43.650 --> 00:34:44.585
Well,

00:34:45.185 --> 00:34:46.420
as for that matter,

00:34:47.588 --> 00:34:50.357
we're working on a special bill...

00:34:50.357 --> 00:34:53.160
to boost the economy...

00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:55.395
through tourism.

00:34:56.029 --> 00:34:56.897
Listen.

00:34:57.397 --> 00:34:59.766
Once it passes,

00:34:59.766 --> 00:35:01.802
we'll coordinate with the Assembly...

00:35:01.802 --> 00:35:07.241
and local governments.

00:35:07.241 --> 00:35:08.709
No problem.

00:35:10.244 --> 00:35:11.879
I see.

00:35:12.713 --> 00:35:15.315
This is Gyumin Tourism Development's...

00:35:15.315 --> 00:35:18.318
first project of this scale.

00:35:19.086 --> 00:35:20.921
Why should I trust...

00:35:20.921 --> 00:35:22.389
an inexperienced company?

00:35:22.823 --> 00:35:24.725
You said trust?

00:35:26.994 --> 00:35:27.861
Yes.

00:35:28.595 --> 00:35:31.431
I need to see some trust from you too.

00:35:36.537 --> 00:35:38.138
(Seongan Police Agency - crime unit)

00:35:38.138 --> 00:35:39.506
Wait, Chairman.

00:35:40.174 --> 00:35:42.176
I can explain.

00:35:42.743 --> 00:35:44.611
Please hear me out. This is a setup.

00:35:45.612 --> 00:35:47.247
Wait, Chairman.

00:35:47.247 --> 00:35:48.048
Hey.

00:35:48.415 --> 00:35:49.416
Stop it!

00:35:50.817 --> 00:35:52.419
Chairman!

00:35:54.621 --> 00:35:55.622
Chairman!

00:35:56.223 --> 00:35:57.324
Let go!

00:35:57.758 --> 00:35:59.459
You bastard, stop it!

00:36:00.294 --> 00:36:01.195
Chairman!

00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:15.576
You broke my trust.
What am I supposed to do about that?

00:36:18.412 --> 00:36:19.246
Chairman.

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:21.849
I swear I had nothing to do with this.

00:36:22.983 --> 00:36:24.484
Please believe me. I'm innocent.

00:36:25.652 --> 00:36:28.488
I don't care
whether you're involved or not.

00:36:29.823 --> 00:36:33.227
To me, trust is just business.

00:36:38.932 --> 00:36:39.800
Sir.

00:36:48.242 --> 00:36:49.576
I had a backup plan.

00:36:49.977 --> 00:36:52.279
I brought in another investor
just in case.

00:37:11.832 --> 00:37:12.799
So you're saying...

00:37:13.133 --> 00:37:15.669
Wei Chang Yu is on her way here?

00:37:15.669 --> 00:37:16.737
Yeah.

00:37:16.737 --> 00:37:17.938
I just figured...

00:37:17.938 --> 00:37:21.308
I figured I'd give you a heads up.

00:37:23.644 --> 00:37:24.645
Got it.

00:37:25.379 --> 00:37:26.380
Good job.

00:37:28.081 --> 00:37:29.349
She'll come back.

00:37:29.349 --> 00:37:30.384
She'll be back.

00:37:31.418 --> 00:37:32.386
What do I do?

00:37:38.659 --> 00:37:40.194
Who are you?

00:37:41.228 --> 00:37:43.063
So Min?

00:37:50.170 --> 00:37:51.238
You two are working together, aren't you?

00:37:51.238 --> 00:37:53.407
No. You've got it wrong.

00:37:53.407 --> 00:37:54.775
You son of a bitch!

00:37:56.343 --> 00:37:57.711
Please don't kill me!

00:37:57.711 --> 00:37:59.413
Everything okay?

00:38:01.615 --> 00:38:04.117
How'd you get her here?

00:38:05.686 --> 00:38:07.754
I set a trap.

00:38:08.455 --> 00:38:09.590
They took the bait.

00:38:11.124 --> 00:38:14.328
From the moment you latched onto me,

00:38:14.962 --> 00:38:17.097
I knew you were playing both sides.

00:38:19.499 --> 00:38:22.769
And I knew you let her escape on purpose.

00:38:23.704 --> 00:38:24.605
But...

00:38:25.606 --> 00:38:28.041
I'll give you credit. You're quite useful.

00:38:31.278 --> 00:38:32.246
That's not true.

00:38:33.914 --> 00:38:34.781
Is that so?

00:38:36.083 --> 00:38:36.984
You're saying it's not true?

00:38:40.621 --> 00:38:42.089
All right, I'll believe you.

00:39:05.512 --> 00:39:07.648
These two...

00:39:08.115 --> 00:39:11.051
screwed up a big deal for me.

00:39:11.818 --> 00:39:13.887
Show me you're trustworthy.

00:39:14.521 --> 00:39:15.422
And...

00:39:15.956 --> 00:39:17.658
Then I'll spare one of them.

00:39:57.798 --> 00:39:59.433
Hate to interrupt the drama.

00:40:11.845 --> 00:40:13.547
Police are looking for me too.

00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:17.951
Don't push so hard, you bastard!

00:40:17.951 --> 00:40:20.020
Be gentle.

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:27.461
Stop them!

00:40:27.461 --> 00:40:28.395
Move!

00:40:28.695 --> 00:40:29.663
Get out of the way!

00:40:30.898 --> 00:40:32.132
Chairman.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.368
We need to go now.

00:40:37.037 --> 00:40:38.438
Chairman.

00:40:40.874 --> 00:40:42.676
Chairman!

00:40:44.545 --> 00:40:47.014
You're useless to the very end.

00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:50.517
Die!

00:41:47.474 --> 00:41:49.810
(No Mercy)

00:41:50.210 --> 00:41:52.846
He accidentally killed the investor.

00:41:53.514 --> 00:41:56.350
Ma Seok Gu supplied the drugs!

00:41:56.350 --> 00:41:58.285
Is there any other evidence?

00:41:58.285 --> 00:42:00.654
Detective Park must've gathered evidence.

00:42:00.654 --> 00:42:02.623
We looked everywhere. Nothing turned up.

00:42:02.623 --> 00:42:04.024
It's me, Park Kye Sun.

00:42:04.024 --> 00:42:04.925
Park Kye Sun?

00:42:04.925 --> 00:42:06.660
Jeong Hun had evidence.

00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:08.529
Ma Seok Gu must have taken it.

00:42:08.962 --> 00:42:10.531
Now there's no telling what he'll do.

00:42:10.531 --> 00:42:11.431
Who did this?

00:42:11.732 --> 00:42:12.966
Who the hell is it?

00:42:12.966 --> 00:42:14.501
Commissioner,

00:42:14.768 --> 00:42:16.837
you need to handle this.

00:42:17.104 --> 00:42:19.039
Kim Mi Yang's daughter is here.

00:42:19.039 --> 00:42:20.774
Hand over Jeong Hun's evidence.

00:42:21.542 --> 00:42:24.311
Everyone around you will suffer,
one by one.

00:42:24.311 --> 00:42:26.813
I'll make it happen.

00:42:27.973 --> 00:42:29.973
