WEBVTT

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.760
You wanted to poison me.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.760
What?

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.760
I'm not dead.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.680
Surprised?

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.880
Today,

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.920
your dear Sinan is getting engaged.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.360
Are you heartbroken?

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.020
I don't need your help anyway.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.640
Do you think your precious Sinan will save you?

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.760
It's none of your business.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.700
Did you really think I wouldn't kill you?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.440
You've killed more people than I can count.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.160
And my biological parents

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.640
were killed by your own hands.

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:50.800
If I told you I didn't kill them,

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.400
would you believe me?

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:54.640
The evidence is conclusive.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.479
What explanation could you possibly have?

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.080
Is this jade pendant yours?

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.320
This pendant...

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.420
Why was it in your possession?

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.400
Just answer yes or no.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.640
Yes.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.240
I found this on Caiyue.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.320
How could a common maid have such an expensive jade pendant?

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.520
After investigating, I discovered this pendant indeed belongs to you.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.360
The murderer who killed my parents was wearing this pendant.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.640
What explanation do you have?

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.400
It's true that this pendant is mine.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.000
But I lost it on my 18th birthday.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.400
This jade pendant was commissioned by the master and mistress

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.400
from the best craftsman in the city for you.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.900
How could you possibly lose such an expensive pendant?

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.120
How am I supposed to believe you?

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.600
I don't care how many people misunderstand me out there,

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.760
but not you.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.120
I didn't come here expecting to leave alive anyway.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.320
Do what you want with me.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.760
I'm just curious,

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.240
how are you still alive?

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.960
Will you always be this good to me?

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.760
Don't overthink it. Go to sleep.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.680
If you call someone's name

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.480
and they avoid eye contact,

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.320
it means they're hiding something.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.680
My mother told me that.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.120
Do you want me dead that badly?

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.560
Yes, you scum. You worthless piece of trash.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.490
You should have been dead long ago.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.480
You want me dead?

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.040
You want me dead?

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.040
I refuse to die.

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:21.839
Otherwise,

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.880
how would I torture you?

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:31.600
Guards!

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.600
Yes.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.480
Lock her up.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.400
Without my permission,

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.560
no one is to let her out.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:40.680
Yes.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.840
Move.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.130
Young Master, you asked for me?

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:03.880
Close the door.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.160
Where did you get this jade pendant?

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.880
Young Master, this is a family heirloom of mine.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.320
Nonsense.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.120
Do you know who it belongs to?

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.240
I don't know.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.480
How dare you.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.280
You have the nerve to steal from me.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.240
I didn't steal it.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.420
Please believe me, Young Master.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.680
This jade pendant

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.480
was a gift from my parents for my 18th birthday.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.680
No wonder it disappeared that day.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.760
So the thief was under my own roof.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.040
What else have you stolen during your years in the Liu household?

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.160
You're wronging me, Young Master!

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.000
I truly haven't stolen anything.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.840
Talk.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.720
You know what I'm capable of.

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:35.690
It's been a while since I've shown my methods.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.380
Today is a good opportunity to practice.

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:42.000
You've been stealing for years.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.840
Even if my father found out, he wouldn't say anything.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.560
Young Master, I'll talk! I'll talk!

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.160
Mother.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.740
Your daughter is useless.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.760
I couldn't avenge you.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:09.960
Who's there?

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.960
Yiyu, it's me.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.160
Yiyu.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.440
Why are you here?

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.160
To see me in such a miserable state?

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.440
Yiyu, how can you say that?

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.600
I brought you some food.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.440
I heard from the servants

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.440
that my brother locked you up here.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.570
I was worried, so I came to check on you.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.130
You're still angry with me?

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.280
What are you doubting?

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.000
My feelings for you?

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.320
Go find your Miss Xu.

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:50.000
Why bother visiting someone as pathetic as me

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.600
and giving me explanations?

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:52.960
Yiyu.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.480
My father worried that as heir, I wouldn't have enough power

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.720
to control the various family factions.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:02.280
So he arranged a marriage alliance with the Yuncheng Commander's family.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.440
But that's just for political advantage.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.440
I don't have feelings for Xu Shuyun.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.240
You must believe me.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.290
You're the only one in my heart.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.780
What difference does it make?

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.880
It's all just an act between us.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.440
Once I secure my position as head of the Liu family,

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.170
I'll break off the engagement.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.720
Then we can truly be together.

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:29.560
Yiyu.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.000
You must believe me.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.960
You're the only one I've ever loved.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.680
Liu Silin, that bastard,

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.450
how dare he lock you up in a place like this.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.980
I won't let him get away with this.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:53.840
Yiyu,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.160
let me get you out of here first.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.960
I'll explain everything later.

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:06.160
I think Liu Silin is coming. You should go.

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:11.720
Yiyu.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.320
I'll leave for now.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.770
I'll find a way to rescue you later.

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:34.880
Sinan.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.680
It's so late.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.440
Why are you here?

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:41.080
That's right. I'm warning you,

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.000
if you bully Qian Yiyu again,

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.320
I won't let you off.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:53.120
Please understand your current situation.

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.380
You're the Commander's future son-in-law.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.880
Stop thinking about your sister-in-law.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.440
I'm warning you for the last time.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:07.320
My woman doesn't need your concern.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.240
Tell me,

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:17.880
what if I tell your father about you secretly meeting Yiyu?

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.500
What would happen?

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.320
Liu Sinan came to rescue you,

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.780
why didn't you go with him?

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.520
All you men are the same,

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.880
for your own selfish interests,

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.410
you'd sacrifice anything.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.520
What are you doing?

00:10:58.680 --> 00:10:59.680
I told you before,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.930
you're the only one who shouldn't wrongly accuse me.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.120
Young Master,

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.920
Young Mistress.

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:13.680
A few days ago,

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:18.240
a traveling merchant was selling this jade pendant at the door.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:20.080
The price was very cheap.

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:24.090
That person specifically instructed not to reveal its source,

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.120
only to say it was a family heirloom,

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:31.680
because it was secretly taken from a wealthy household.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.880
I was tempted by the low price

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:38.000
and bought it when I saw it was genuine.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.440
But, young master,

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.440
I truly didn't know it was yours.

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.080
Did you get a clear look at that person?

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:49.240
That person was wearing a large felt hat

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:50.960
that covered their face.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.690
I couldn't see clearly.

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.880
Five years.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.380
Finally returned to its rightful owner.

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.760
So, does this prove my innocence?

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:23.240
Do you remember where you lost your jade pendant?

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.880
At the Fulu Restaurant.

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:29.160
The banquet wasn't even over

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.290
when it couldn't be found anymore.

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:32.880
Because of this,

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:35.880
my father gave me a severe scolding.

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:38.560
Fulu Restaurant.

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:00.680
Yu.
