"Love in the Moonlight"
(Episode 10)

00:01:32.157 --> 00:01:35.220
It's only afternoon and
you need a drink already?

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.180
You're worried about me?

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.701
How kind of you.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.500
But you're not as kind
to me as you are to Sasin.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.457
You worked with them to fool me,

00:01:56.917 --> 00:01:59.000
tried to destroy our wedding.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.260
I wanted to save Prince Saenkaew, Sasin

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:08.740
and you.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.380
Saved me?

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.060
I became a clown and nobody ever thought
of telling me anything.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.841
It's so painful to see your
cousin and your fiancé that way,

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.400
do you want to know how I feel?

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.480
Please let go of Prince Saenkaew.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.660
If you're keeping him like
this, you will end up in pain.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.660
If I let him go,

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.260
I will feel less pain than this?

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.260
I don't think so.

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.700
Don't let your anger
and sorrow lead your life,

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.460
in the end, a person
who will feel the most pain

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.020
could be you.

00:02:58.701 --> 00:03:00.741
It's so painful that I can't
feel anything anymore.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.060
Two people that I love the most

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.381
betrayed me at the same time.

00:03:10.723 --> 00:03:13.024
It can't get worse than this.

00:03:13.537 --> 00:03:14.538
Sure it can.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.100
It will be much worse than this

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.220
if you continue to choose this path.

00:03:22.261 --> 00:03:26.262
You know that it won't end well.

00:03:28.397 --> 00:03:30.860
One day, you could wake up and realize that

00:03:31.777 --> 00:03:33.297
a man who you love with all your heart

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.479
looks at you with full of hatred.

00:03:38.221 --> 00:03:41.180
One day, you could hear
Prince Saenkaew call your name

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.820
but it isn't in a gentle
tone like he used to.

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.780
Instead, his voice will be
full of anger and torment.

00:03:51.387 --> 00:03:54.100
That is the day that
you will finally realize

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.300
the taste of real pain.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.460
I'm the bad guy in this equation.

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.100
I'm fine if one more person hates me.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.100
What? You need more
time to develop the films?

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.700
I thought it would be ready today.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.540
You just gave me the film last night.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.900
We need a few days to get it done.

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.991
Honey.

00:04:57.403 --> 00:04:59.180
I think we won't get anything tonight.

00:04:59.404 --> 00:05:01.005
They are all leaving.

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.200
Hiding like this won't lead us anywhere.

00:05:04.557 --> 00:05:07.256
Too many mosquitoes, we should go.

00:05:08.823 --> 00:05:09.824
Saenkaew.

00:05:18.657 --> 00:05:19.658
Honey.

00:05:20.577 --> 00:05:21.578
Take a picture!

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.100
We got the good ones
but they won't develop in time!

00:05:38.783 --> 00:05:41.068
Your nephew is getting married tomorrow.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.200
Should we try another shop?

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.460
You still have to wait at another shop.

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.060
I can guarantee you that

00:05:49.291 --> 00:05:51.291
our shop provides the
fastest service in Thailand.

00:05:52.597 --> 00:05:54.400
Can you finish it tomorrow?

00:05:55.643 --> 00:05:56.644
I don't think so.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.820
It's graduation season,
so many films to develop.

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:03.931
What should we do?

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.900
- What're you doing?
- Trust me.

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:14.700
- Let go.
- What're you doing?

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.038
Honey?

00:06:18.062 --> 00:06:20.600
If I give you all of this,
can you finish it tomorrow?

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:23.300
Honey, you can't do that!

00:06:23.376 --> 00:06:25.260
This is all we have!

00:06:25.537 --> 00:06:29.580
Oh, darling. If we can't get
the pictures to stop the wedding,

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.860
you think Kalong would let
you live to spend more money?

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:48.100
Prioritize us.

00:06:48.537 --> 00:06:50.060
Get it done tomorrow.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.620
Sure, you'll be the
first. I'll try my best.

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.021
Good job.

00:07:09.843 --> 00:07:12.740
So you two know all about this?

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:16.540
Thank you for not leaving your friend.

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:21.821
We won't do that. He did nothing wrong.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.580
He's just in love.

00:07:28.517 --> 00:07:29.980
I saw Pin today.

00:07:30.517 --> 00:07:33.140
She seemed so furious, she
wouldn't listen to a word I said.

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:39.580
I'm her cousin, I should be
the one she could rely on to.

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:41.820
Instead, I stole her lover.

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:44.900
Of course, she's furious.

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:49.540
No matter what, she shouldn't
marry Prince Saenkaew.

00:07:50.583 --> 00:07:52.620
In the end, a person
who will feel the most pain

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.500
is her.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.140
But the wedding is tomorrow.

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:00.800
What're we gonna do?

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.820
Should we go to the wedding
and take Prince Saenkaew away?

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:07.060
His father's gonna shoot you in the head.

00:08:07.523 --> 00:08:10.100
Don't forget that he
almost killed Sasin last time.

00:08:12.983 --> 00:08:16.580
Also, I think his father will be
more cautious during the wedding.

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:20.020
But there are so many people there

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:22.241
it should be the best chance

00:08:22.941 --> 00:08:25.542
if we get there and take him away.

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:32.000
We only have this chance for one day.

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:47.060
According to Chansaeng's tradition,

00:08:47.297 --> 00:08:51.900
there is thread tying blessing
ceremony for the newlyweds.

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:56.941
But his dad cut out this part.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:02.860
Still, I wanted to give
you two this tradition.

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:07.741
Please come closer.

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:20.580
This cotton thread that is tying today

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:24.400
will not only be tied on your wrists

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:27.500
but it is also tying your hearts

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:31.540
to stay together.

00:09:45.263 --> 00:09:46.860
Staying together

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.820
could be smooth and rough.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.460
You two need to help each other

00:09:54.401 --> 00:09:58.540
facing problems, don't turn
your backs against one another.

00:10:01.917 --> 00:10:04.818
I wish you a lifetime

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:08.000
of happiness and love.

00:10:13.957 --> 00:10:14.958
What?

00:10:20.023 --> 00:10:21.400
What's wrong?

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:26.101
Your words truly touched me.

00:10:30.657 --> 00:10:33.420
It's getting late and they

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:37.300
need to wake up early tomorrow.

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:40.220
Should we let them go to bed?

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:44.781
Goodnight.

00:11:15.837 --> 00:11:18.020
You can't cry like this tomorrow.

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:20.200
People will get suspicious.

00:11:22.663 --> 00:11:23.664
Pin?

00:11:25.077 --> 00:11:26.100
I'm sorry.

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:29.781
- But I want you to reconsider…
- Do I have other choices?

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:34.660
If I call off the wedding,

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:37.860
people will say that I got
stood up on my wedding day.

00:11:39.903 --> 00:11:41.783
Khunying Wad has been
scolding and insulting me

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:44.140
since I can remember.

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:47.701
What do you think my life would be

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:50.140
if I got dumped right before the wedding?

00:11:52.017 --> 00:11:53.018
Pin?

00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:59.481
I used to think that if I had a
chance to run away from this place

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:02.540
and lived my own life,

00:12:05.397 --> 00:12:07.420
I would be so happy.

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:13.701
But you all destroyed my dream

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:17.060
and no one ever cared about my feelings.

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:21.801
You think my happiness

00:12:22.897 --> 00:12:24.898
means nothing to you?

00:12:28.257 --> 00:12:29.460
You know that

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:35.303
if we get married, you
won't be happy either.

00:12:35.401 --> 00:12:38.980
Let my happiness be
decided in the future.

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:43.140
You're gonna marry me
tomorrow no matter what.

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:24.701
Sasin.

00:13:25.701 --> 00:13:29.200
Don't you worry, everything
will go as we planned tomorrow.

00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:32.100
I really hope so.

00:13:33.303 --> 00:13:35.300
I need to get Saenkaew out of there.

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:42.880
Thank you for not leaving
me behind and sorry

00:13:43.501 --> 00:13:44.821
for risking your lives like this.

00:13:45.702 --> 00:13:47.003
We want to help.

00:13:48.543 --> 00:13:51.020
If you want to pay us back, it's fine.

00:13:52.303 --> 00:13:56.460
When Ms. Rachawadee hosts your wedding,

00:13:57.297 --> 00:14:00.220
don't forget to invite
us as your groomsmen.

00:14:03.298 --> 00:14:06.217
Sure, you're all I have.

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:05.500
Why don't you give her a ring?

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:00.683
You need to be cautious,

00:16:01.263 --> 00:16:03.820
if you find anyone suspicious,

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:07.000
- don't let them inside.
- Yes, sir.

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:11.340
I wish your love gets stronger

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:14.060
and lasts forever.

00:16:19.777 --> 00:16:23.110
Stay in love and happiness forever.

00:16:23.543 --> 00:16:26.300
Please take care of Saenkaew for me.

00:16:38.423 --> 00:16:40.180
Marriage is more than love

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:46.100
but it is a promise to your bride's family

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:48.780
that you will take care of their daughter

00:16:49.897 --> 00:16:52.020
like her parents used to take care of.

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:57.081
You've done a good job as a son, now

00:16:57.981 --> 00:17:02.780
you need to be a good husband to Pin-anong.

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:37.110
How was it?

00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:39.470
Everything is under control, sir.

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:42.580
There will be many people
at the reception this evening.

00:17:42.923 --> 00:17:44.380
Tell our people to be more cautious

00:17:45.037 --> 00:17:46.780
don't let anything messy happen.

00:17:47.857 --> 00:17:48.940
Yes, sir.

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:52.541
It can't be any mistake tonight.

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:57.461
I will take Saenkaew and Pin-anong to
get marriage certificate tomorrow

00:17:58.140 --> 00:17:59.540
and get on the train to Chiang Mai.

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:02.820
We will not come back here again.

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:03.860
It's me.

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:05.861
Come in.

00:19:15.757 --> 00:19:16.758
What is it?

00:19:26.377 --> 00:19:28.260
Certificate of No Impediment?

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:31.180
I went out to get flowers this morning

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:33.370
and Sasin waited to see me.

00:19:33.541 --> 00:19:35.820
- How much?
- Two baht per kg.

00:19:35.883 --> 00:19:37.140
- Give me one.
- Aunt Thip?

00:19:38.657 --> 00:19:39.790
Sasin?

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:41.883
Why're you here?

00:19:42.263 --> 00:19:44.900
I'm waiting for you, I know
that you're here every morning.

00:19:47.264 --> 00:19:48.700
Can you help me with something?

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:54.020
He asked me to get this for you.

00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:59.660
He will have you get a marriage certificate
with Ms. Rachawadee.

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:04.301
Thank you so much.

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:07.741
You risked it for me.

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:11.900
If everything follows the plan,

00:20:13.883 --> 00:20:15.620
I will transfer the assets

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:19.180
and come back to help everyone.

00:20:21.141 --> 00:20:25.742
If it doesn't go to plan,

00:20:27.349 --> 00:20:29.772
if it all gets destroyed,

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.340
- you need to run away far from here.
- Nope.

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:39.421
I won't leave anyone behind.

00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:42.660
I'll come back to save you all.

00:20:44.617 --> 00:20:46.618
About the assets from our timber business,

00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:52.220
when it's time, they will come back to us.

00:20:55.203 --> 00:20:56.420
But this opportunity

00:20:56.904 --> 00:20:59.905
for you to be with someone you love

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:06.200
is rare to find.

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:09.141
If you lose it,

00:21:10.577 --> 00:21:12.940
you won't get a second chance.

00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:17.071
But…

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:19.461
I will take care of your grandma.

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:23.100
You've sacrificed

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:28.950
and you've tortured yourself
for everyone for too long.

00:21:32.017 --> 00:21:33.018
You need to

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:36.741
find your own happiness,

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:39.460
okay?

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:09.780
Can I see your invitation please?

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:17.491
Welcome.

00:22:21.977 --> 00:22:24.860
Don’t let anyone without an invitation in.

00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:26.371
Okay.

00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:31.000
Can I see your invitation please?

00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:57.101
So beautiful, my girl.

00:22:58.670 --> 00:22:59.671
Let me see.

00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:11.541
Listen to me.

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:16.380
Thank you for being a
good daughter for our family.

00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:23.351
If your married life isn't that happy,

00:23:23.851 --> 00:23:26.660
tell me and I'll handle it.

00:24:21.183 --> 00:24:22.184
Saenkaew.

00:24:25.017 --> 00:24:26.018
Yeah?

00:24:26.837 --> 00:24:27.838
What is it?

00:24:51.963 --> 00:24:53.340
You should dress well

00:24:55.303 --> 00:24:56.504
for your important day.

00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:00.011
Okay.

00:25:02.117 --> 00:25:03.360
It's almost time.

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.861
I should go and welcome our guests.

00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:12.051
Saenkaew.

00:25:19.023 --> 00:25:22.124
Thank you for your sacrifice.

00:25:56.397 --> 00:25:57.717
Can I see your invitation please?

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:05.221
Welcome.

00:26:05.497 --> 00:26:06.817
Can I see your invitation please?

00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:08.950
Can I get a picture?

00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:12.451
Smile please.

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:15.711
One more.

00:26:16.217 --> 00:26:17.218
Thanks.

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:19.860
Congratulations.

00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:24.420
Thank you so much for coming.

00:26:24.771 --> 00:26:26.772
Let me take you to your seat.

00:26:34.923 --> 00:26:36.100
Good evening, Songsawat.

00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:38.861
The Field Marshal is busy

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:43.100
so he sent me here. He
also said that he was sorry.

00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:47.420
Thank you so much for coming.

00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:49.400
Of course, we're friends.

00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:59.401
I don't know if I should
say congratulations to you.

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:02.301
I know that this is not what you wanted.

00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:07.140
It must be my fate.

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:12.100
Why don't I believe that someone like you

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:14.301
would relent to your fate?

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:18.900
Anyways, I'd like to wish you

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:22.181
a successful path in everything.

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:28.980
- Good evening, Songsawat.
- Good evening.

00:27:29.783 --> 00:27:30.784
Let's take a picture.

00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:54.780
Don't yawn or I'll follow you.

00:27:55.210 --> 00:27:58.020
- I'm so tired.
- You can lean on my shoulders here.

00:28:03.203 --> 00:28:05.204
- I got them.
- You got them!

00:28:05.504 --> 00:28:06.505
Here.

00:28:08.017 --> 00:28:10.140
Finally!

00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:27.391
Honey!

00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:36.811
Let's go.

00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:40.980
It's time to get to the wedding, honey.

00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:52.860
Hurry up, baby.

00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:55.961
- Honey.
- Yeah?

00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:58.500
You don't think of helping me row?

00:28:58.857 --> 00:29:00.260
It's against the current.

00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:02.940
I don't know how, baby.

00:29:03.177 --> 00:29:05.540
Stop whining and keep rowing.

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:09.540
- Are we almost there?
- Not yet, let's go.

00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:16.180
- I'm helping you.
- You're not helping.

00:29:25.857 --> 00:29:26.858
Follow me.

00:29:42.243 --> 00:29:43.244
Sasin?

00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:47.500
Let's get in from the back,
Kamsu wont focus on this.

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:50.400
We can sneak into the wedding. Let's go.

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:52.460
- Follow me.
- You need to patrol this area.

00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:54.071
Kamsu!

00:29:55.637 --> 00:29:57.820
Oh my! Cover up, come on.

00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:00.751
This way.

00:30:10.397 --> 00:30:12.420
- Aunt Homthip.
- Yeah?

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:14.420
What're you doing here?

00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:16.971
What?

00:30:17.703 --> 00:30:20.704
I'm here to check on something.

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:24.060
The guests are starting to arrive.

00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:26.741
What're you talking about?
The guests won't arrive here.

00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:29.621
What's that noise?

00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:35.821
- Who's there?
- Hey!

00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:38.200
It's nothing.

00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:40.661
You're imagining things.

00:30:41.117 --> 00:30:43.420
Let's get back to the reception.

00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:53.100
You act so weird tonight.

00:30:57.660 --> 00:30:58.661
Don't!

00:31:00.103 --> 00:31:01.104
Move!

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:04.105
I told you that it was nothing.

00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:06.780
You need to bring your
people somewhere else.

00:31:07.241 --> 00:31:08.850
You need to catch her.

00:31:09.357 --> 00:31:10.597
Kamsu!

00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:15.380
- Let me go!
- Stay still.

00:31:15.741 --> 00:31:16.742
Hey!

00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:22.180
- What?
- Just stay still.

00:31:24.417 --> 00:31:25.418
Let me go!

00:31:28.197 --> 00:31:29.198
Let me go!

00:31:51.537 --> 00:31:53.740
- Hurry up, my baby.
- Honey!

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:55.980
- I'll wait up there, follow me.
- Sure.

00:31:56.790 --> 00:31:57.791
Prince Inthorn.

00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:04.820
What're you doing here?

00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:08.140
Baby, you need to go!

00:32:09.863 --> 00:32:11.860
- Stop right now!
- Let me go.

00:32:12.163 --> 00:32:14.740
Let me go! What do you want from me?

00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:17.100
Catch him! Hurry up!

00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:35.800
You can come out now.

00:32:40.283 --> 00:32:41.284
They're gone.

00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:45.850
Prince Inthorn? The one who
attacked the party last time.

00:32:46.431 --> 00:32:49.940
It seems to be getting out of hand. We need
to hurry up to get Saenkaew out of here.

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:51.801
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

00:33:12.143 --> 00:33:13.977
- Sir?
- What's going on?

00:33:18.543 --> 00:33:21.263
Prince Inthorn tried to sneak into
the reception and he dropped this.

00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:24.461
Is everything okay?

00:33:25.790 --> 00:33:28.791
Yeah, it's fine.

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:32.341
Excuse me.

00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:34.580
Let's go, take me there.

00:33:37.977 --> 00:33:39.750
Tell our people to search for Inthorn.

00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:42.980
Don't let him show this disgusting picture.

00:33:43.583 --> 00:33:44.584
Yes, sir.

00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:54.750
Where're you going?

00:34:00.857 --> 00:34:04.380
I told you not to come here.

00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:08.381
Please stop doing that.

00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:11.220
You need to let them go.

00:34:15.123 --> 00:34:16.860
You knew about this?

00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:27.941
Just great.

00:34:29.657 --> 00:34:31.020
He's the bad guy

00:34:32.397 --> 00:34:34.100
and everyone is helping him.

00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:38.001
Nobody cares for me.

00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:42.341
Sasin?

00:34:45.741 --> 00:34:46.742
Saenkaew.

00:34:49.323 --> 00:34:50.324
Saenkaew.

00:34:51.643 --> 00:34:52.644
Let's get out of here.

00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:57.060
Stop, right there.

00:35:33.697 --> 00:35:34.800
Can I get this?

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:38.503
I don't think so.

00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:43.460
I made this one for Saenkaew.

00:35:52.723 --> 00:35:55.220
Help! Somebody, help!

00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:59.221
- This way!
- What's going on? What's with the noise?

00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:03.741
The bride and groom are here.

00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:06.940
I've been looking for you.

00:36:07.483 --> 00:36:10.020
Sasin?

00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:17.100
Sasin is Pin-anong's cousin.

00:36:17.517 --> 00:36:19.800
Three of them are so close.

00:36:22.537 --> 00:36:23.538
Good evening.

00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:25.381
Nice to meet you.

00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:28.201
What're you doing back here?

00:36:28.301 --> 00:36:30.497
Why don’t you attend
the reception from the front?

00:36:30.521 --> 00:36:31.320
That's right.

00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:35.180
Sasin and his friends are
here to congratulate us.

00:36:35.941 --> 00:36:37.620
But they're about to leave.

00:36:39.123 --> 00:36:40.124
Right?

00:36:43.210 --> 00:36:45.100
I think I should stay a little longer.

00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:59.300
- I can, can't I? Grandma?
- Sure.

00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:02.401
Let's get inside. Did you have your dinner?

00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:04.422
- Not yet.
- Let's go and eat then.

00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:06.200
Let's go get you something to eat.

00:37:06.503 --> 00:37:10.665
You two need to get inside.
It's not good to be gone for too long.

00:37:11.741 --> 00:37:13.342
Come on, boys. Let's eat.

00:37:26.317 --> 00:37:27.318
Wait.

00:37:31.723 --> 00:37:32.724
Sir?

00:37:33.743 --> 00:37:35.900
Someone saw Prince Inthorn
running into the building.

00:37:37.297 --> 00:37:38.298
Everyone,

00:37:38.783 --> 00:37:43.000
search everywhere. Don't let
him get inside the reception.

00:37:43.357 --> 00:37:44.358
Yes, sir.

00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:11.660
Kamsu is following me closely like a tick.

00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:14.020
How can I get inside the reception?

00:38:23.243 --> 00:38:24.420
Thank you.

00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:43.980
I'm so grateful.

00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:49.141
You're not fully recovered,
still you're here at my wedding.

00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:54.180
You want to see me in
my happiest day, don't you?

00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:02.540
How can he miss a wedding of

00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:08.660
his best friend and his baby cousin, right?

00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:39.341
Everyone,

00:39:43.037 --> 00:39:44.500
I'm the bride's cousin.

00:39:45.977 --> 00:39:48.340
And I'd like to gift the bride
and groom with this song.

00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:35.220
He is singing this song to mock me

00:41:35.690 --> 00:41:37.380
for getting in your way, isn't he?

00:42:02.303 --> 00:42:03.304
Thank you.

00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:08.740
Why don't we serenade
you with one more song?

00:42:09.097 --> 00:42:10.098
Enough.

00:42:12.023 --> 00:42:14.063
It's time for the bride and
groom to say something.

00:42:22.270 --> 00:42:24.860
It's your time to be up
on the stage, let's go.

00:42:43.997 --> 00:42:46.260
Everyone, please listen to me.

00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:52.741
That's Prince Inthorn.

00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:55.460
This wedding is a fake one.

00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:57.861
They're trying to fool you.

00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:02.011
Inthorn!

00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:04.300
Stop doing crazy thing.

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:06.501
Your son is doing something crazy.

00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:10.500
He's crazy and he's not like us.

00:43:11.330 --> 00:43:14.300
Everyone, Prince Saenkaew

00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:17.021
isn't the best groom like you think he is.

00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:23.340
He has a secret he's trying to hide.

00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:38.300
And I have proof in my hand.

00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:43.820
Dad? What's going on?

00:43:44.163 --> 00:43:48.100
He has photos of you and Sasin.

00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:55.820
- Stop!
- Don't get any closer.

00:43:58.257 --> 00:43:59.660
Get him out of here.

00:44:18.283 --> 00:44:19.620
Why is there a black out?

00:44:20.477 --> 00:44:22.940
- What's going on?
- Get a flashlight.

00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:24.860
- Get him! Now!
- Yes, sir.

00:44:25.850 --> 00:44:27.580
You need to look at the photos.

00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:29.901
Let me go! You need to see the photos.

00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:32.171
You scumbag! Let me go!

00:44:32.923 --> 00:44:35.060
Fire! Let's get out of here!

00:44:35.877 --> 00:44:38.300
- Fire!
- Fire?

00:44:38.620 --> 00:44:41.100
- Fire?
- Fire!

00:44:41.170 --> 00:44:44.171
- Ma'am!
- Fire?

00:44:49.777 --> 00:44:50.780
Watch out!

00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:02.540
You need to get your
boyfriend out of here, Sasin.

00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:04.181
Saenkaew!

00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:20.431
This way!

00:45:56.637 --> 00:45:57.980
What is in the photos?

00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:08.540
Some nonsense photos,
you don't have to worry.

00:46:14.537 --> 00:46:16.420
I'm not going! Let me go!

00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:19.980
I'm not going! You scumbag! I'm a nobleman!

00:46:20.130 --> 00:46:21.180
Let me go!

00:46:21.323 --> 00:46:22.924
Kamsu! Let me go!

00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:28.821
Prince Bodin, I have a proof.

00:46:29.521 --> 00:46:31.140
You need to look at the photos.

00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:33.441
It’s a photo of Saenkaew and Sasin…

00:46:36.220 --> 00:46:37.400
Keep him in a room.

00:46:47.077 --> 00:46:48.078
Sir?

00:46:55.260 --> 00:46:56.261
Prince…

00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:02.340
Sir? Sir?

00:47:11.970 --> 00:47:12.971
Are you okay?

00:47:15.763 --> 00:47:16.764
Saenkaew?

00:47:17.650 --> 00:47:20.300
What're you doing here? Where is the fire?

00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:23.711
There is no fire.

00:47:25.411 --> 00:47:26.860
I need to run away from the wedding.

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:35.300
Saenkaew! Saenkaew!

00:47:39.140 --> 00:47:41.060
My car is parked by the fence, the red one

00:47:41.097 --> 00:47:43.900
with license plate
number Kor Tor 2275. Run!

00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:45.340
I'll handle it from here.

00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:49.700
- Thank you.
- No need to. We're friends.

00:47:51.543 --> 00:47:54.140
Help! Help me!

00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:58.060
Help! Help me!

00:47:59.817 --> 00:48:01.860
Help! Help me!

00:48:02.683 --> 00:48:03.684
Help!

00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:07.820
- Ms. Songsawat?
- Someone is trying to hurt me.

00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:09.060
Who?

00:48:11.317 --> 00:48:12.318
Saenkaew?

00:48:13.563 --> 00:48:14.740
Take care of her.

00:48:49.150 --> 00:48:50.710
This is a certificate from the embassy.

00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:53.620
I'll get a marriage certificate
with Ms. Rachawadee.

00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:56.260
My dad will agree to our plan.

00:48:58.180 --> 00:49:00.500
After that, we will be together.

00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:07.340
I promise you that I won't let go of you.

00:50:04.490 --> 00:50:05.810
Hey!

00:50:06.283 --> 00:50:07.284
Hey!

00:50:07.343 --> 00:50:08.660
Sasin!

00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:10.501
Hey!

00:50:11.540 --> 00:50:12.541
How're you feeling?

00:50:17.330 --> 00:50:18.331
Hey!

00:50:22.923 --> 00:50:23.924
How're you?

00:50:24.697 --> 00:50:25.698
I'm fine.

00:50:32.423 --> 00:50:33.424
Saenkaew!

00:50:45.773 --> 00:50:46.774
Don't!

00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:48.421
No!

00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:50.240
- No!
- You think you can run away from me?

00:50:52.290 --> 00:50:54.291
You're trying to run! Why's that?

00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:56.500
Please let us go. I beg you.

00:50:56.740 --> 00:50:58.041
Go where?

00:50:58.643 --> 00:51:00.460
I'll follow you until you're dead.
