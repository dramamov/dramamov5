WEBVTT

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.920
Hey.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.970
It's supposed to be a cheerful melody,

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.080
yet why does it sound so sorrowful?

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.400
It's from the Dunhuang Music Collection,

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.600
the 'Cup-Raising Song' you're playing, isn't it?

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.080
Indeed.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.760
I didn't expect anyone besides Sister Pang

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.960
to understand music in this household.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.000
This piece was originally meant to express joy and freedom.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.960
But your playing

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.289
carries a hint of longing and melancholy.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.600
It actually adds a unique charm to it.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.080
Rather than 'Cup-Raising Song,'

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.880
it might better be called 'Heart-Pouring Lament.'

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.039
Has it been so long

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.680
that you no longer take my words seriously?

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.410
Sister Pang.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.440
Who gave you permission to leave the small courtyard?

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.800
Nongyu didn't mean to disobey you.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.080
It's just that preparing medicine for Master Chen

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.280
cannot be neglected.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.400
Stop using Master Chen to pressure me.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.920
Are you so idle lately

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.680
that you come here to listen to music?

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.039
Well,

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.840
what's so important about preparing medicine?

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.120
This is the flower garden.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.840
I'm planting medicinal herbs now

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.520
that won't be ready until next year.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.650
Perhaps you could condescend to help?

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.520
You just know how to brew some medicinal soups.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.180
What's so special about that?

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.680
Why don't you do it then?

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.280
Stop arguing.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.720
It's Master Chen.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.650
What are you all quarreling about?

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.250
Is my garden not big enough?

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.760
Can't it accommodate the three of you?

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.560
Godfather,

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.040
it's not Sister's fault.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.060
I was the one who overstepped.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.040
I just thought the flower bed was beautiful.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.720
I didn't realize that every plant and tree

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.680
was carefully designed and planted by you.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.000
I was too bold

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.960
wanting to plant herbs here.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.420
If Sister Pang hadn't stopped me,

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.280
I would have caused a disaster

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.610
and ruined this garden.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.400
Sister Pang was right to scold me.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.600
I know you meant well.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.860
I admit my mistake.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.640
I thought it was something serious.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.970
Isn't this a good thing?

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.120
Nongyu,

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.160
I've heard

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.900
that you don't even dare to leave your quarters.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.240
That's unnecessary.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.080
Look,

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.440
my residence is so pleasant.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.650
Come out for a stroll when you're free.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.040
And while you're at it,

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.840
planting some flowers and herbs would be nice too.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.450
Thank you, Master Chen.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.760
Did you find out about what I asked you to investigate?

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.130
Yes, sir.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.880
Wei Cheng did serve as an imperial inspector in his early years.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.280
His hands weren't clean.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.440
He was involved in many bloody affairs.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.160
But it was 13 years ago,

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.900
so it's hard to verify now.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.240
It's possible that Nongyu

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.320
had a grudge against him.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.480
That dog Wei Cheng

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.300
is a disgrace to the court.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.760
There are plenty who want to skin him alive.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.120
If he hadn't been in Fanyang,

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.120
gaining An Lushan's favor

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.720
and An Qingxu's friendship,

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.680
I would have sent him to hell with one stroke long ago.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.640
This Nongyu is full of tricks.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.170
Pang Shiyuan is no match for her at all.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.720
They can fight even over a flower bed.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.040
Sir.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.040
It's not because of the flower bed.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.500
It's because of Tong Luan.

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:17.760
This Tong Luan,

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.399
taking advantage of her early fame

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:20.930
and her skill with the pipa,

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.360
has been flirting with everyone in the mansion,

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.960
seducing men left and right.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.180
Such an undisciplined creature.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.000
I need to find a chance

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.320
to teach her a good lesson.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.440
I'll make you learn your lesson

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.240
and see if you dare to do it again.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:44.880
Bear with it.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.409
Does it hurt?

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.460
No, it doesn't.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.840
It must be that bitch Nongyu

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:55.220
who poisoned Master Chen against you

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.000
and made things difficult for you,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.460
which led to this beating.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.040
Just wait.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.010
I'll definitely get revenge for this.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:10.320
Nongyu.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.330
What are you doing here?

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.320
I specially prepared some medicinal plaster

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.980
that works well for injuries.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.840
That sounds nice,

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.680
but Tong Luan got beaten because of you.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.640
You must be feeling quite pleased with yourself.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.880
I sincerely want to help him heal.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.010
As for why he was beaten,

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.680
whether you believe it or not,

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.540
it truly has nothing to do with me.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.280
Fine.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.920
Even if this incident has nothing to do with you,

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.320
you're always flirting with Master Chen

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.200
just to compete with us for his attention, aren't you?

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.480
I didn't come to this household to make enemies

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.740
or to compete with anyone for attention.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.010
I'm just an orphan girl.

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:56.090
To survive in these chaotic times,

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.520
I must cling tightly to the Chen household.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.850
Sister Pang,

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.360
we both live under the same roof,

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.300
surely you can understand my difficulties.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.970
We're both drifters in this world,

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.400
so why hurt each other?

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:11.360
Master.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.880
Sir,

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.880
urgent news!

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.810
Something terrible has happened!

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.560
Just as I expected.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.220
The divination was accurate.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.690
Danger lurks within good fortune.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.400
Tong Luan is just like us.

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:40.890
When the whip strikes his body,

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.900
I can certainly feel his pain.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.520
If Nongyu encounters trouble in the future,

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.720
I hope Sister Pang and Brother Tong Luan

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.570
will show some compassion.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.159
Sister Shiyuan, please calm down.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.170
Besides, my back is hurting badly.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.120
Let's apply some medicine first.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.250
Apply the medicine.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.580
How should we respond?

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.480
I already have a plan.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.580
Kill two birds with one stone.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.000
Stop!

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.040
Dr. Li.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:37.640
Let him in.

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:38.800
Yes.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:48.520
I am Li Ling,

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.840
paying my respects to the Imperial Physician.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:51.600
Please sit.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.540
This is the case that Chen Jingbian had made.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.440
No need to open it.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.560
Just take it back untouched.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.410
As for this drawing,

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.240
whether it will be placed in this case in the future

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.400
is meaningless.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.280
This is merely Chen Jingbian's

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.680
way of creating a diversion.

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.010
I don't understand.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:25.680
Li Ling,

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.920
do you know why you have failed

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.260
to obtain the Night Firefly Drawing?

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.480
Please enlighten me.

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:36.000
Because in your eyes,

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.159
it's just a drawing.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:41.080
You haven't seen what's behind this drawing.

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:44.680
What's behind it?

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.080
Isn't it the spy network?

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.140
Chen Jingbian has been in the imperial harem for years,

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.000
staying close to the emperor,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.720
with eyes and ears everywhere,

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.760
knowing every official in court.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.720
He was also personally guided by Gao Lishi.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.560
Do you think he merely arranged

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.920
some spies and informants?

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.360
Why do you think he's able to maintain his position?

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.760
I've survived until now.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.560
Why, when Great Yan was at its peak,

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.520
did Shi Siming suddenly suffer defeat

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.730
and surrender to our Tang army?

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:22.800
Could it be

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:26.960
also because of Chen Jingbian's intelligence?

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.090
Playing both sides,

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.040
reaping benefits from all parties.

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:32.280
Chen Jingbian has the means to do so.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.440
His network of spies now spreads throughout the land.

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.840
This is his bargaining chip for trading favors,

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.480
and his weapon to control others' fates.

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.320
This old fox is so cunning.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:49.520
Doctor.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.680
I think we should just finish him off.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.280
Without their leader,

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:56.410
let's see how they can stir up trouble.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.840
The most frightening thing isn't Liuying,

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.340
but the Dark Night.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.320
Chen Jingbian knows too many secrets.

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:07.920
If he dies,

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.720
those secrets that should remain hidden in darkness

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.440
will be exposed to the light.

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:15.760
When that happens,

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.320
not just you and I,

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.840
but even His Majesty

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.680
would likely find himself in trouble.

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:24.490
So you're saying

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:27.000
Chen Jingbian cannot be touched at all?

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:27.560
No,

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:29.200
I mean

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:33.000
he cannot be touched until we find the Dark Night Firefly Map.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.600
This is also His Majesty's wish.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:39.440
I understand.

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:42.520
Obtaining the Dark Night Firefly Map is absolutely essential.

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:44.760
I will not disappoint you.

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:46.170
Alright,

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:47.800
you should go now.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:48.840
Oh,

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:52.040
there's a friend waiting for you.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:54.160
A friend?

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:02.560
Qi.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:06.000
Qi.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:07.920
Brother Ling.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:15.530
It really is you!

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:16.570
Long time no see.

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.320
Xie Zheng.

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:53.960
Sun Wang.
Kang Xiaorui.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:54.690
Kang Sunrui.

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:57.320
Ying.

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:58.120
Wang Linwang

00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:58.920
Ying Lu.
Wang Linwang.

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:02.000
Tong Liu.
Hao Xiao.

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:08.560
Li Zhang.

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:09.560
Li Zhang.

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.090
Li Zhang.

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:20.000
Liu Wang.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:20.480
Jia Ningrao Jiaying Xidou Rong.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:21.400
Jia Ningtao Jia.

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:22.360
Jia Ningtao Jiaying Xidou Rong Jing Shou Peng.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:25.160
Jia Ningtao Jiaying Xidou Rong Jing Shou Peng Hua.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:31.920
Li.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:33.280
Assistant Li.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.240
Li Sheng Lanfeng Tao.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:38.640
Xian Gong.

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.220
Gong Xian Gong.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:40.360
Xian.
