WEBVTT

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.920
Wei.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:02.480
Li Ling.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:03.880
Stop fighting.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.680
Stop fighting. Let's go!

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.280
Let's go!

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.240
Sir, you go first.

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:20.640
Li Ling.

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:22.320
We need to settle our score.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.850
We need to settle our score.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.360
You're taking advantage of my situation.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.360
Do you even choose your time to kill?

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.600
Li Ling.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.840
Go.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.140
Back to the courtyard.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.840
What's going on here?

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.660
Isn't this Officer Li?

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.920
Li Ling.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.800
Li Ling.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.160
Li Ling.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.820
Li Ling.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.240
You're awake.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.740
Li Ling.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:29.220
Li Ling.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:30.300
Li Ling.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:31.360
Li Ling.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.320
So much blood.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.040
I'm afraid he won't make it.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.720
Indeed.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.160
It's terrifying.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.440
Such severe injuries.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.160
Everyone get out of the way!

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.600
These wounds are serious.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.530
Don't you have eyes? Stop gawking!

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.980
Li Ling.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.079
Greetings, Master Chen.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.000
How did this happen?

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:55.850
Are you alright?

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.280
I'm fine.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.920
Thank you for your concern.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:59.780
What about him?

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:01.560
Is he alright?

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.040
Master, you pray to Buddha with sincerity.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.160
Surely the Bodhisattva will protect us.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.320
As your servants,

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.800
we too shall overcome difficulties

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.960
and turn misfortune into blessing.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.180
Use the best medicine available.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.760
Spare no expense.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.400
You must save Clerk Li's life.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.100
Nongyu will do everything possible.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.020
Li Ling.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.520
Li Ling.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:55.890
Sister Shiyuan.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.560
Do you know what's going on

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.690
between Nongyu and Officer Li?

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.520
How would I know?

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.360
Speaking of our boss.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.440
He really is something.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.280
Just him alone

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.840
taking on the entire guard station.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:10.840
Isn't that right?

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.280
If it weren't for Officer Li

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.080
and that Nongyu,

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.940
he'd probably be in grave danger.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.320
But for a woman,

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:17.800
do you think it's worth it?

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:18.320
Exactly.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.840
You just don't understand.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.800
This is called following each other in life and death when love runs deep.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.240
Nongyu is so lucky.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.400
Yes, indeed.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.300
I don't understand these things either.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.920
Sir.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.260
How's it going?

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.480
The Wei family's gates are tightly closed.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.740
We're still investigating the details.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.760
They must be seriously injured.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.000
Someone might even die.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.200
If Wei hadn't suffered a major defeat,

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.400
with his temper,

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.520
he would be yelling

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.720
and coming here to settle scores by now.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.000
Go now.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:05.600
Yes.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.620
I never thought Li Ling

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.440
would be so ruthless.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.340
He's certainly given me quite a problem.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.920
Let's pin everything we've done

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.280
on Li Ling alone.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.860
Once he's dead,

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.560
everything will be over.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.770
I'll tell them right now

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.320
to stop treating him.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.680
Come back.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.600
After all, he's brought prestige to our Chen family.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.280
This dog who's earned respect,

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.480
if you don't save him,

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.320
who else will be your dog in the future?

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.200
Save him however you can.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.060
We'll figure something out with the Wei family.

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:50.680
Yes.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:14.720
You're awake.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.410
How are you feeling?

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:20.320
Yan Bo.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:21.520
What?

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.000
Yan Bo.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.640
I saw Yan Bo.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.280
I know who you are now.

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:32.400
Yan Bo told me earlier

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.409
to protect you at all costs.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:42.970
Why are you here?

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.440
After what happened today,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.260
I'm worried about you.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:50.520
It's all my fault.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:51.440
Yes,

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.330
I'm the one who harmed them.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.900
How can this be your fault?

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.360
You had no choice.

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.050
Did you see how Li looked today?

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:01.100
If I hadn't told Wei Cheng,

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.540
they wouldn't have arrested Nongyu.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:04.280
Li Ling

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.530
wouldn't have gone to save her.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.570
If it's not my fault,

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:12.780
then whose fault is it?

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.490
But if you hadn't done this,

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.760
Wei Cheng would have killed you anyway.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.040
Even if not for yourself,

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.290
you need to think about Rui'er.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:25.520
Rui'er...

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:28.260
My dear Rui'er.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:30.320
My son and I

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.240
will eventually be killed by Wei Cheng.

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:37.820
But when that happens,

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.080
who will save me?

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:41.679
I will.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.330
I will save you both.

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.840
I wish I could be like Li,

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.620
storm into Wei's mansion,

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:50.600
rescue Rui'er,

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:51.960
and set you free.

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:56.800
Yan Bei told me

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.780
that you joined the Guantian Society

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.400
to seek revenge.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:06.640
No.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.530
There are things

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.320
I must say now.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:17.760
I've had dealings

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:20.210
with the Guantian Society before.

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:21.680
I know better than anyone

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.780
what they're really like.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:25.780
Nongyu.

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.650
Yan Bei has been worried about you.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:35.320
No matter how the Guantian Society threatens you,

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:36.520
I want you to know that

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:37.920
whatever you seek,

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.240
I can help you achieve it.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.820
But you can barely protect yourself now.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:47.920
No,

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:49.560
I'm not alone.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:50.960
Behind me

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.170
is the entire Tang Dynasty.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.460
I am a Tang soldier.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.000
I've been undercover in the Chen household for years,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:00.880
all for the day

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.080
when Tang forces reclaim Chang'an.

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:06.020
I didn't know about your background before,

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:07.880
so I was cautious around you.

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.360
But things are different now.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:10.840
Nongyu.

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:12.480
From now on,

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.290
will you let me help you?

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:24.620
You say you're with the Tang army.

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:27.400
Not just me.

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:28.540
Zhuang Yao,

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:29.120
A'qi,

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.090
they're all Tang soldiers.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.320
I'm grateful for your rescue.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.560
But I won't join your restoration army.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.640
I would rather join the Guantian Society

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:46.480
than join you.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:49.000
Why?

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.820
We've been through so much together.

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:56.240
I thought you would understand my feelings, Nongyu.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.700
My name isn't even Nongyu.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.960
You don't need to know my real name.

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.080
There are many things I didn't tell Yanbo.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.740
I was afraid of burdening him.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.200
But I can tell you this.

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:08.890
My entire family

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.400
was killed by your Tang army.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.320
Suppressing rebellion.

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.120
Restoration.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.020
None of that means anything to me.

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.330
Because my family is already dead.

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:24.780
My only purpose for living

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.400
is revenge.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.000
And your beloved Great Tang

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.160
is the culprit.

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:37.600
From today on,

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.120
you go your way,

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:40.640
I'll go mine.

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:43.880
We're destined to walk different paths.
