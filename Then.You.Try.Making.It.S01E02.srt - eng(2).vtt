But if I had to say one thing...

00:00:02.167 --> 00:00:04.767
...the side dishes are a little too brown overall.

00:00:05.267 --> 00:00:08.133
It would be better to add a little more color.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.467
I'll be more careful next time.

00:00:10.467 --> 00:00:13.567
That's not a homemade bento. It's a "thawed-out" bento.

00:00:13.567 --> 00:00:14.467
You're right.

00:00:14.467 --> 00:00:15.533
-Right? -Ayumi.

This is no good.

00:00:29.967 --> 00:00:31.367
I'm gonna go wash my face.

00:00:31.367 --> 00:00:32.400
Okay.

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:36.500

Oh, there's Chikuzenni.

00:01:04.233 --> 00:01:06.067
Did he not notice me?

00:01:08.567 --> 00:01:09.633
What's wrong?

00:01:10.233 --> 00:01:11.567
It's nothing.

00:01:11.667 --> 00:01:13.367
But you really went all out.

00:01:13.367 --> 00:01:14.733
With your hair color, I mean.

00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:20.667
Oh, it was because of my hair color.

00:01:20.667 --> 00:01:23.067
But it looks really good on you.

00:01:23.067 --> 00:01:24.267
Really?

00:01:26.767 --> 00:01:32.300
He didn't notice me just because I changed my hair color.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.267
Should I dye it?

00:01:35.267 --> 00:01:36.500
Dye it.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.400
What color are you gonna dye it?

00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:40.633
All blue.

Yes, nice to meet you.

00:02:00.733 --> 00:02:02.267
This hair color is nice, right?

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.733
I really love it. It's like an alien.

00:02:06.467 --> 00:02:08.067
An alien?

00:02:08.067 --> 00:02:09.233
Yeah.

00:02:10.667 --> 00:02:13.033
Do you want to try this color?

00:02:13.033 --> 00:02:15.100
No, I'll just go with something normal.

00:02:15.767 --> 00:02:17.267
What do you mean by normal?

00:02:18.467 --> 00:02:20.667
What does "normal" mean to you?

00:02:21.833 --> 00:02:26.400
You know, a hairstyle that's considered normal for everyone.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.867
But everyone's hairstyle is different.

Why all of a sudden...?

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.000
Because I'm curious.

00:02:44.667 --> 00:02:46.167
Well...

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.400

What do I even like?

00:03:08.233 --> 00:03:11.467
Ever since I was little, rather than thinking about what I liked...

00:03:11.467 --> 00:03:13.633
...I spent more time thinking about how to be liked.

00:03:13.633 --> 00:03:17.133
That's nice. Ayumi, you're so cute.

00:03:17.133 --> 00:03:19.667

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.967

Don't tell me this is your first time seeing one.

00:06:55.167 --> 00:06:57.600
Right? That's what makes it so good.

Thanks for your hard work.

00:08:38.633 --> 00:08:40.100
You changed your hair color again!

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.567
-I did. -It looks great on you!

00:08:41.567 --> 00:08:43.200
That hair color is so cool.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.567
-So beautiful. -Come hang out!

00:08:52.333 --> 00:08:53.567
How nice.

00:08:54.633 --> 00:08:57.733
She must know exactly who she really is.

00:08:58.433 --> 00:09:02.267
Just by that, she can be her most natural self...

00:09:02.267 --> 00:09:04.833
...marry the person she loves...

00:09:04.833 --> 00:09:06.800
...and make lots of friends.

00:09:17.933 --> 00:09:20.567

Right?

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.233
A lot of people think tequila is just for getting drunk...

00:09:40.233 --> 00:09:42.000
...but it's actually very aromatic and delicious.

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:44.667
That's great.

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:48.733

00:10:08.667 --> 00:10:10.067
This is so much fun.

00:10:12.167 --> 00:10:13.300
So fun.

00:10:15.767 --> 00:10:17.933
To be able to not think about anything...

00:10:17.933 --> 00:10:20.233
...and just enjoy the moment.

00:10:21.767 --> 00:10:22.733
But...

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:38.533
Welcome home.

00:10:38.533 --> 00:10:40.333
-I'm home. -Are you okay?

00:10:41.367 --> 00:10:43.367
You didn't have to come pick me up.

00:10:43.367 --> 00:10:48.000
But you rarely stay out so late.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:48.933
I just felt like it for once.

00:10:48.933 --> 00:10:50.133
Thanks.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.033
Thanks for leaving dinner for me.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.967
But freshly made is still the best, after all.

00:10:56.967 --> 00:10:59.967
The flavor changes when you microwave it.

00:11:01.467 --> 00:11:05.733
Also, the eggplant in the miso soup...

00:11:05.733 --> 00:11:07.933
...seems a bit out of season.

00:11:08.767 --> 00:11:11.233
Right, it's already autumn.

00:11:11.233 --> 00:11:13.633
But it's better than store-bought.

00:11:13.633 --> 00:11:17.067
Those are all made with dashi powder.

00:11:18.033 --> 00:11:19.467
Unbelievable.

00:11:30.367 --> 00:11:31.333
Hello?

00:11:31.333 --> 00:11:34.733
"Hello? Ayumi, let's go out to eat tonight."

00:11:34.733 --> 00:11:35.867
Tonight?

00:11:35.867 --> 00:11:38.067
"Yeah, it has to be tonight."

00:11:38.067 --> 00:11:41.133
"I'll be waiting at a restaurant called 'Rose' at 7 PM."

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.200
He's going to propose, isn't he?

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:12.200
(Dashi Powder)

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.967
Am I going to do this for the rest of my life?

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:41.600
Ayumi, marry me.

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.567
I can't.

00:12:59.467 --> 00:13:00.500
Ayumi.

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:13.667
What have I done?

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:18.333
Did I just do something incredibly stupid?

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:38.100
Ayu-ayu!

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:39.367
Are you serious about running away from home?

00:13:39.867 --> 00:13:41.933
Please let me stay here.

00:13:42.833 --> 00:13:44.400
We've only met for the second time.

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.367
This way of closing the distance is a bit weird, don't you think?

00:13:46.367 --> 00:13:48.600
But I have nowhere else to go.

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.067
I guess I have no choice.

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:54.433
-Here, give it to me. -It's heavy.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.867
How about...

00:14:05.967 --> 00:14:07.767
...this?

00:14:09.633 --> 00:14:11.333
How did it come to this?

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:14.967
Somehow...

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:17.400
...it's incredibly exciting.

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:23.633
We live so close, I thought we might run into each other someday.

00:14:26.033 --> 00:14:27.433
This is not right.

00:14:29.433 --> 00:14:32.967
The paella that Ayu-ayu made last time was so delicious.

00:14:32.967 --> 00:14:33.967
Really?

00:14:33.967 --> 00:14:35.333
You're such a good cook.

00:14:35.567 --> 00:14:38.300
If everyone enjoys it, it makes me want to cook more.

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:40.233
It was delicious, but...

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:45.467
...it tasted completely different from Ayumi's cooking.

00:14:45.467 --> 00:14:47.000
Of course it's different.

00:14:52.333 --> 00:14:57.167
I want to eat Ayumi's Chikuzenni again.

00:14:57.433 --> 00:15:01.000
You can stay at my place for the rest of your life!

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:04.033
Really? I might actually take you up on that.

00:15:04.033 --> 00:15:06.033
It's fine, as long as you cook for me.

00:15:06.033 --> 00:15:07.967
I will...

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:14.133
Then, You Try Making It!

00:15:19.867 --> 00:15:21.000
"Mornin'."

00:15:22.333 --> 00:15:27.167
"I always thought that because it was morning, I'd see you standing in the kitchen."

00:15:27.933 --> 00:15:29.400
"But I was wrong."

00:15:31.867 --> 00:15:35.900
"It's because you are standing in the kitchen that morning comes."

00:15:37.733 --> 00:15:39.267
"This is happiness."

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:44.467
"To feel so much happiness just from making breakfast."

00:15:45.367 --> 00:15:46.400
"Truth."

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:49.533
"I want to make breakfast for Shun forever."

00:15:49.533 --> 00:15:51.067
Oh no...

00:15:51.733 --> 00:15:53.633
-"Forever and ever..." -Oh no...

00:15:54.567 --> 00:15:57.167
This is still a little too much for me.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.433
Okay, perfect.

00:16:00.433 --> 00:16:01.667
Let's eat.

00:16:10.867 --> 00:16:12.367
The taste is off.

00:16:17.533 --> 00:16:20.300
You're spacing out. Are you okay?

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:23.667
I'm fine.

00:16:24.233 --> 00:16:25.167
I'm fine.

00:16:25.167 --> 00:16:26.867
Glad to hear it.

00:16:27.767 --> 00:16:31.000
But sometimes it helps to talk to someone.

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:36.333
Hold it in, Katsuo.

00:16:36.333 --> 00:16:38.667
One day you'll have to be the pillar of the family.

00:16:38.667 --> 00:16:40.333
You can't show weakness to others.

00:16:40.867 --> 00:16:42.900
You're a man.

00:16:43.367 --> 00:16:44.633
No...

00:16:45.133 --> 00:16:47.033
No, sorry. I'm fine.

00:16:49.133 --> 00:16:53.400
Why don't you try a dating app to cheer yourself up?

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:58.967
Why? That's so weird.

00:16:58.967 --> 00:17:01.400
-It's not like I was dumped... -Okay.

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:05.367
But meeting new people will definitely help you feel better.

00:17:07.167 --> 00:17:09.233
I don't want to get married.

00:17:09.233 --> 00:17:11.100
-They're all just looking for casual dates... -That's ridiculous.

00:17:11.533 --> 00:17:13.767
What's the point of a connection like that?

00:17:14.433 --> 00:17:18.200
It's better for men and women to meet naturally.

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:21.167
Just like how wild-caught fish tastes better than farmed fish.

00:17:21.433 --> 00:17:26.767
(Katsuo's Fantasy)
A true connection will appear naturally.

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:29.233
(Farming Experiment in Progress)

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.533
Look closely.

00:17:31.533 --> 00:17:33.900
This is the power of nature.

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.833
There are no good men on dating apps.

00:17:42.833 --> 00:17:44.600
At least more than are around me.

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:49.033
(Minamikawa's Fantasy)

00:17:49.033 --> 00:17:50.800
You're so slow.

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:54.467
It's a fish.

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:57.800
Delicious.

00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:59.067
Eat up...

00:17:59.067 --> 00:17:59.900
Let's eat.

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:01.700
Thanks for your hard work.

00:18:05.133 --> 00:18:06.300
While you're being prejudiced...

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:09.667
...you might be missing out on something truly important.

00:18:11.333 --> 00:18:15.200
Dating apps used to have a dangerous reputation...

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:17.433
...but now they're mainstream.

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:22.100
I'm not using one.

00:18:24.833 --> 00:18:28.933
Because my ideal woman is someone like Ayumi.

00:18:28.933 --> 00:18:31.933
Reserved, with a cute smile.

00:18:31.933 --> 00:18:35.100
You won't find a girl like that so easily.

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:36.833
You think?

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:39.533
Thank you.

00:18:39.533 --> 00:18:41.067
A girl like that...

00:18:41.067 --> 00:18:42.433
...usually finds someone else right after a breakup.

00:18:42.433 --> 00:18:44.167
(Let's go for a drink sometime.)
...usually finds someone else right after a breakup.

00:18:44.433 --> 00:18:45.833
I'll wait for your message.

00:18:46.933 --> 00:18:48.433
That's not true.

00:18:48.433 --> 00:18:50.333
Ayumi might be popular...

00:18:50.767 --> 00:18:51.867
...but she doesn't just fall for anyone...

00:18:51.867 --> 00:18:53.867
You really don't get it, do you?

00:18:54.233 --> 00:18:58.400
The one who isn't moving on might just be you.

00:18:59.267 --> 00:19:02.967
Ayumi would never do that.

00:19:17.133 --> 00:19:18.933
Are you looking for tequila?

00:19:19.567 --> 00:19:21.567
No, someone asked me to buy some...

00:19:21.567 --> 00:19:24.700
We have samples. Would you like to try some?

00:19:26.733 --> 00:19:27.733
Okay...

00:19:27.733 --> 00:19:28.700
Welcome.

00:19:28.967 --> 00:19:31.033
This one is called Añejo.

00:19:31.033 --> 00:19:33.667
It's been aged in a barrel for over a year.

00:19:38.067 --> 00:19:39.600
Thank you.

00:19:41.567 --> 00:19:43.233
Such a beautiful amber color.

00:19:43.233 --> 00:19:44.300
Isn't it?

00:19:44.967 --> 00:19:47.033
-Well then, I'll have a taste. -Please.

00:19:51.833 --> 00:19:53.133
Delicious.

00:19:53.733 --> 00:19:55.933
It tastes completely different from what I usually drink.

00:19:56.633 --> 00:19:58.367
Do you drink tequila often?

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000
I feel like girls who like tequila...
tend to drive people away.

00:20:03.767 --> 00:20:04.800
No, that's not... uh...

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:07.033
I have some with lower alcohol content, too.

00:20:07.033 --> 00:20:09.100
Excuse me, thanks for the tasting.

00:20:15.433 --> 00:20:18.867
Ebihara, you'll find someone else.

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:23.900
No, it seems Ebihara-san doesn't want a connection that's easy to find.

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:25.367
Why not?

00:20:26.633 --> 00:20:28.667
Ebihara...

00:20:28.667 --> 00:20:30.633
No good, he's not listening at all.

00:20:30.633 --> 00:20:31.933
The shock must be too much for him to move on.

00:20:31.933 --> 00:20:34.267
Whiskey and coke... I don't get it.

00:20:36.067 --> 00:20:38.833
Minamikawa Amina likes to drink whiskey and coke.

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:47.300
A sweet and strong drink like whiskey and coke...

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:49.633
...how could it possibly go with food?

00:20:50.267 --> 00:20:53.167
I want to say that, I really want to say that...

00:20:53.167 --> 00:20:55.333
...but that would be a gaffe, right?

00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:00.800
Don't say it. It's fine. I won't say it.

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:03.067
I'll absolutely keep my mouth shut.

00:21:03.067 --> 00:21:04.500
Ebihara...

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:06.400
Ebihara...

00:21:07.067 --> 00:21:08.733
You should order something.

00:21:08.733 --> 00:21:11.267
It's best to eat a lot when you're feeling down.

00:21:16.933 --> 00:21:20.067
It turned into an acrostic poem for "Whiskey and coke doesn't match at all."

00:21:20.767 --> 00:21:23.067
No, don't say it.

00:21:23.067 --> 00:21:25.300
Katsuo, don't be tempted.

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:27.267
I want to say it, but I can't.

00:21:27.267 --> 00:21:29.500
I want to say it, but I can't.

00:21:31.167 --> 00:21:32.633
What's wrong, Ebihara?

00:21:32.633 --> 00:21:35.500
He can't hold back his emotions, can he?

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:37.600
I didn't know he was suffering that much.

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:40.233
Chief, I'll have another whiskey and coke.

00:21:40.233 --> 00:21:43.133
Minamikawa-san, you really love that drink.

00:21:43.133 --> 00:21:46.367
Yeah, it goes great with everything.

00:21:46.367 --> 00:21:49.100
For me, the happiest moment...

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:51.467
...is eating grilled offal at Shichimon-ya with a whiskey and coke...

00:21:51.467 --> 00:21:52.933
Grilled offal?

00:21:53.867 --> 00:21:56.300
A sticky, cloyingly sweet whiskey and coke...

00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:57.900
...with smelly, alien-like offal?

00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:59.867
Just imagining it is...

00:22:03.033 --> 00:22:06.933
Whatever. I don't expect you to understand anyway.

00:22:11.833 --> 00:22:15.800
What do you mean, "don't expect you to understand"?

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:24.667
Where is it?

00:22:26.267 --> 00:22:27.800
Whatever, this will do.

00:22:34.933 --> 00:22:36.500
Damn it.

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:43.167
You wouldn't understand.

00:22:44.067 --> 00:22:49.033
I don't think I want you to understand anymore.

00:23:01.333 --> 00:23:02.633
Damn it.

00:23:04.567 --> 00:23:05.767
Conditions?

00:23:06.067 --> 00:23:10.233
His family situation isn't bad, and his future looks promising.

00:23:10.833 --> 00:23:12.767
I have to consider his family, too?

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.700
He's a good match for marriage and kids...

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:19.667
...and for growing old together.

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:22.800
That's not what "like" means, is it?

00:23:23.433 --> 00:23:26.567
Tell me, why do you like tequila?

00:23:27.333 --> 00:23:31.167
Tequila is just delicious.

00:23:31.167 --> 00:23:32.233
See?

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.400
That's what "like" is, isn't it?

00:23:37.567 --> 00:23:40.533
I did think his conditions were good, but...

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:47.767
...sometimes it felt like it was more than just that.

00:23:52.933 --> 00:23:54.400
The key...

00:24:12.467 --> 00:24:15.633
Usually, he'd be home by now.

00:24:37.667 --> 00:24:39.733
-Is this for me? -I thought you'd like it.

00:24:39.733 --> 00:24:41.233
I've always wanted this!

00:24:41.233 --> 00:24:43.733
-Great! -I'm so happy! Why did you get this for me?

00:24:43.733 --> 00:24:44.967
Because it's our anniversary today.

00:24:44.967 --> 00:24:47.200
No way, today's our anniversary?

00:24:47.667 --> 00:24:49.133
I knew you forgot.

00:24:49.133 --> 00:24:51.233
-No way, it's today? -It's today.

00:24:51.233 --> 00:24:52.600
-Is it our anniversary already? -Yep.

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:55.367
Oh no, I'm sorry, I didn't prepare anything.

00:25:03.267 --> 00:25:04.400
So good.

00:25:12.667 --> 00:25:14.600
Could it be...

00:25:15.433 --> 00:25:18.267
...that I'm a little lonely?

00:25:27.667 --> 00:25:29.233
Today was so fun.

00:25:29.233 --> 00:25:30.600
It was really fun.

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:32.400
You have to take me again.

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:33.733
Of course.

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.300
But...

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:38.267
I really want some ice cream.

00:25:38.267 --> 00:25:41.867
-Next time. -Next time? Will they still have that flavor?

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:44.167
Doing that kind of thing in a place like this...

00:25:51.867 --> 00:25:55.000
But even when we're together, it feels kind of lonely.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.633
Awesome!

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:06.933
When can we go?

00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:09.000
Next week.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.500
I really want some ice cream.

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:13.600
-Next time. -Will they still have that flavor?

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.333
Doing that kind of thing in a place like this...

00:26:25.933 --> 00:26:27.300
What's wrong?

00:26:29.067 --> 00:26:30.533
What is it?

00:26:32.667 --> 00:26:34.467
Back then, I was so self-conscious...

00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:37.067
...I didn't even dare to hold her hand outside.

00:26:41.733 --> 00:26:43.067
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:26:43.067 --> 00:26:45.267
Time for a drink.

00:27:00.733 --> 00:27:02.933
I wonder what Ayumi is doing right now.

00:27:20.633 --> 00:27:23.000
-Morning. -Morning.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.700
I'm so hungover...

00:27:24.933 --> 00:27:26.133
Where did you go?

00:27:26.133 --> 00:27:27.533
Shichimon-ya.

00:27:27.533 --> 00:27:28.767
You really love that place.

00:27:28.767 --> 00:27:31.567
The grilled offal there is so good.

00:27:31.567 --> 00:27:33.567
Especially the shiro and kashira.

00:27:33.567 --> 00:27:37.133
I could eat shiro and kashira with whiskey and coke for the rest of my life.

00:27:40.133 --> 00:27:41.333
I think I'm gonna be sick.

00:27:48.367 --> 00:27:50.600
I can't believe I came here.

00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:01.367
(Kashira, Shiro)
What on earth are kashira and shiro?

00:28:01.367 --> 00:28:02.600
They're delicious.

00:28:03.033 --> 00:28:05.033
Then I'll have the kashira and shiro.

00:28:05.033 --> 00:28:06.767
And to drink, I'll have...

00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:10.233
-A whiskey and coke. -Right away.

00:28:11.567 --> 00:28:13.133
Why is he here?

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:15.333
Miss.

00:28:15.667 --> 00:28:17.567
The young lady who was looking for tequila.

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:24.267
-You're the guy from the liquor store... -Please wait.

00:28:28.733 --> 00:28:30.967
-Good evening. -Good evening.

00:28:30.967 --> 00:28:36.000
I'm looking for appetizers to pair with a new tequila I got in.

00:28:36.667 --> 00:28:38.967
Would you like to come and try some with me?

00:28:40.067 --> 00:28:43.800
No, I'm not a very good drinker.

00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:47.200
It's this one.

00:28:48.033 --> 00:28:49.633
Have a little.

00:28:52.333 --> 00:28:53.533
Kashira and shiro.

00:28:53.533 --> 00:28:55.100
Let's eat.

00:28:58.033 --> 00:28:59.467
So delicious.

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:03.400
It goes down so smooth.

00:29:06.133 --> 00:29:09.100
Delicious. I see.

00:29:09.567 --> 00:29:11.633
So this is pork cheek.

00:29:12.933 --> 00:29:14.767
I see.

00:29:15.667 --> 00:29:18.667
Then what is shiro?

00:29:22.233 --> 00:29:23.600
Delicious.

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:30.067
I guess you never know until you try.

00:29:30.067 --> 00:29:31.633
Exactly.

00:29:32.033 --> 00:29:34.833
Here's your whiskey and coke.

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:42.833
-So good. -Glad you like it.

00:29:43.667 --> 00:29:45.033
By the way...

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:47.933
I want to see if this drink suits these kinds of appetizers.

00:29:47.933 --> 00:29:48.867
Yakitori?

00:29:48.867 --> 00:29:50.200
And sushi.

00:29:50.867 --> 00:29:53.000
Shouldn't the side dish be Mexican food?

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000
I want to find appetizers that are more readily available.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.500
To make tequila more approachable.

00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:00.500
Will it really match?

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:06.400
Let's give it a try and find out.

00:30:06.933 --> 00:30:08.067
Okay.

00:30:11.133 --> 00:30:12.333
So sweet.

00:30:13.933 --> 00:30:22.500
But the aroma of the spices makes the taste of the offal refreshing.

00:30:23.433 --> 00:30:24.633
I see.

00:30:24.633 --> 00:30:26.900
How's the whiskey and coke?

00:30:27.667 --> 00:30:28.800
You were here?

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:30.367
I was. I saw you, too.

00:30:30.367 --> 00:30:32.700
What? You should've said something.

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:37.167
I'm in the process of opening a new window in my life.

00:30:38.667 --> 00:30:40.400
It goes well with oden, too.

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:41.833
-Really? -Yeah.

00:30:42.467 --> 00:30:44.367
This is fun.

00:30:44.367 --> 00:30:46.167
-Right? -Yes.

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:53.333
I can't stop drinking this tequila.

00:30:54.833 --> 00:31:00.033
When you discover something new, it's as if the world has expanded.

00:31:00.033 --> 00:31:01.467
It's fun, isn't it?

00:31:02.233 --> 00:31:03.667
It really is fun.

00:31:03.667 --> 00:31:05.267
-Right? -Yeah.

00:31:06.933 --> 00:31:10.667
But you can really hold your liquor.

00:31:12.767 --> 00:31:15.700
Oh... that's true.

00:31:16.567 --> 00:31:19.433
Then why did you say you couldn't drink?

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:27.633
The person I used to date...

00:31:27.633 --> 00:31:31.200
...was the type of person who thought all girls were light drinkers.

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:33.433
I bought some more drinks.

00:31:33.433 --> 00:31:34.867
Thanks.

00:31:34.867 --> 00:31:35.667
What's everyone drinking?

00:31:35.667 --> 00:31:36.533
I'll have a shochu highball.

00:31:36.533 --> 00:31:37.633
-Me too. -Ayumi can just have oolong tea.

00:31:37.633 --> 00:31:39.267
Here, oolong tea.

00:31:40.233 --> 00:31:41.933
You can't drink much, so you don't have to.

00:31:42.267 --> 00:31:44.600
What a reliable guy. So cool.

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:46.967
Even though I could actually drink more...

00:31:47.633 --> 00:31:50.767
...to be the perfect girlfriend...

00:31:50.767 --> 00:31:53.433
...I had to pretend I was a light drinker.

00:31:54.600 --> 00:32:00.033
From that moment on,
I always tried to be the perfect girlfriend.

00:32:01.767 --> 00:32:09.433
Gradually, I lost sight of what I really thought.

00:32:12.133 --> 00:32:14.233
What a waste.

00:32:15.433 --> 00:32:19.933
He never got to see you enjoying a drink so happily.

00:32:22.267 --> 00:32:24.833
I, for one, would love to have a drink with you.

00:32:33.567 --> 00:32:35.033
-I'll have a beer. -Right away.

00:32:35.033 --> 00:32:37.533
Didn't you just say you opened a new window?

00:32:37.533 --> 00:32:40.833
I'm still a beer person, after all.

00:32:41.767 --> 00:32:43.933
But...

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:48.633
...I think I understand a little why you feel happy drinking that.

00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:52.733
I've learned that there's a world I never knew.

00:32:52.733 --> 00:32:53.967
Here's your beer.

00:32:53.967 --> 00:32:54.900
Thanks.

00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:58.133
If you're always prejudiced, you can't broaden your horizons.

00:32:59.433 --> 00:33:01.000
Indeed.

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:10.133
But your thoughts about this are probably related to your ex-girlfriend, right?

00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:14.933
-I bought more drinks. -Thanks.

00:33:14.933 --> 00:33:15.633
What's everyone drinking?

00:33:15.633 --> 00:33:16.467
Shochu highball for me.

00:33:16.467 --> 00:33:17.700
-Me too. -Ayumi can just have oolong tea.

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:19.033
Here, oolong tea.

00:33:19.033 --> 00:33:21.200
You can't drink much, so you don't have to.

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:23.167
-Thanks. -What a reliable guy. So cool.

00:33:23.167 --> 00:33:25.367
I was always just assuming things...

00:33:25.367 --> 00:33:28.700
...about what Ayumi probably wanted to eat or drink.

00:33:30.067 --> 00:33:32.100
I never noticed.

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:37.900
But what she actually wanted...

00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:41.900
...I wouldn't know unless I asked her.

00:33:44.633 --> 00:33:47.000
You seem to have changed.

00:33:48.167 --> 00:33:49.433
You think?

00:33:49.433 --> 00:33:51.600
The guy I used to date...

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:54.633
...would probably say that tequila is a flirty drink.

00:33:54.633 --> 00:33:56.467
There are still people like that?

00:33:56.900 --> 00:34:00.533
But I was like that until just recently.

00:34:00.533 --> 00:34:05.467
I thought tequila was only for flirty people...

00:34:05.467 --> 00:34:08.067
...and had nothing to do with me.

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:11.867
Delicious.

00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:18.200
You're really cute.

00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:24.000
The way you enjoy your tequila is very cute.

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:33.267
Look, your face is a little red.

00:34:33.267 --> 00:34:34.667
It is.

00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:38.600
Let's take a picture.

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:48.000
Great shot.

00:34:48.633 --> 00:34:50.700
It really is.

00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:59.867
Oh, that reminds me.

00:35:01.233 --> 00:35:04.800
Are you left-handed by any chance?

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:07.167
Yes.

00:35:07.167 --> 00:35:08.467
Me too.

00:35:08.467 --> 00:35:10.033
We're the same!

00:35:10.433 --> 00:35:11.667
Which hand do you use to eat?

00:35:11.667 --> 00:35:13.667
-My left hand. -Me too.

00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:16.167
What about throwing?

00:35:16.167 --> 00:35:18.133
I throw with my right hand.

00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:19.833
-Same here! -We're the same.

00:35:19.833 --> 00:35:22.467
When I first talked to Katsuo...

00:35:22.967 --> 00:35:25.333
...I completely forgot about his "conditions."

00:35:25.333 --> 00:35:28.233
It was a feeling that couldn't be explained by logic.

00:35:35.567 --> 00:35:38.200
I noticed something.

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:39.867
Shrimp-Cutlet's bento.

00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:43.400
His side dish is Chikuzenni every day.

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:44.767
Every day?

00:35:44.767 --> 00:35:47.700
And he looks miserable every single day.

00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:49.100
Why?

00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:51.033
Is he okay?

00:35:53.933 --> 00:35:57.667
Don't you dislike Ebihara-san?

00:36:00.633 --> 00:36:01.800
Well, yeah.

00:36:02.267 --> 00:36:06.300
But I think I get what you were saying now.

00:36:07.133 --> 00:36:08.367
Hey...

00:36:10.133 --> 00:36:12.167
There's something I want to talk to you guys about.

00:36:12.767 --> 00:36:15.333
-Come on in. -Excuse me.

00:36:15.333 --> 00:36:17.567
-I bought some stuff. Put it here. -That's huge.

00:36:17.567 --> 00:36:19.067
Shirasaki, come to the kitchen.

00:36:19.433 --> 00:36:21.733
-Then I'll borrow your kitchen. -Please do.

00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:25.467
Hey, are you starting to drink already?

00:36:25.833 --> 00:36:28.067
To be honest, I didn't even invite you.

00:36:28.067 --> 00:36:29.800
It's fine, it's fine.

00:36:30.867 --> 00:36:36.100
Shirasaki, you're going to teach me the secret to Chikuzenni, right?

00:36:36.867 --> 00:36:40.600
I don't know the secret to Ayumi-san's Chikuzenni.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:46.000
But I'm going to teach you the secret to enjoying Chikuzenni.

00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:14.200
-Canned tomatoes? -Yep.

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:15.967
-No way. -Done.

00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:17.933
-You're adding curry roux? -Yes.

00:37:17.933 --> 00:37:19.267
Are you serious?

00:37:31.533 --> 00:37:33.167
I'm thirsty.

00:37:34.767 --> 00:37:35.767
So good.

00:37:36.133 --> 00:37:37.267
Hello.

00:37:37.833 --> 00:37:40.600
"I came to return the key."

00:37:43.833 --> 00:37:45.267
Is that Ayumi?

00:37:54.733 --> 00:37:57.967
I haven't returned your key yet.

00:38:08.633 --> 00:38:09.900
Goodbye.

00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:14.133
Ayumi?

00:38:14.133 --> 00:38:17.833
Since you're here, why don't you have some curry?

00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:20.867
The rice is almost ready.

00:38:22.567 --> 00:38:24.967
Curry is best when eaten together.

00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:31.100
Ayumi, let's eat together.

00:38:36.567 --> 00:38:39.200
Minamikawa, clean up your empties.

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:40.400
Okay.

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:47.233
Ayumi, you can sit there.

00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:49.833
Have a seat.

00:38:49.833 --> 00:38:52.333
Shirasaki, I'll take care of the rest.

00:38:52.333 --> 00:38:54.200
Then I'll leave it to you.

00:38:58.533 --> 00:39:02.933
Ebihara cooks now, you know.

00:39:03.833 --> 00:39:06.167
To get closer to your flavor...

00:39:06.167 --> 00:39:09.333
...he's been making Chikuzenni every day.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.333
Katsuo is cooking...?

00:39:14.467 --> 00:39:16.600
Hard to believe, isn't it?

00:39:17.133 --> 00:39:19.967
He's trying hard to change.

00:39:21.233 --> 00:39:22.267
What is it?

00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:24.667
What are you talking about?

00:39:25.567 --> 00:39:27.200
This looks good.

00:39:27.433 --> 00:39:29.600
I can taste-test it for you.

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:32.333
You haven't done anything.

00:39:32.333 --> 00:39:34.167
What are you so proud of?

00:39:34.167 --> 00:39:36.000
Then I'll leave it to you.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.267
Okay.

00:39:38.633 --> 00:39:41.200
For Ebihara-san's level, this is pretty good.

00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:43.500
Let me see, too.

00:39:45.633 --> 00:39:48.567
But it feels like it needs a more impactful flavor.

00:39:48.567 --> 00:39:50.967
-What should we do? -Is there anything we can add?

00:39:50.967 --> 00:39:52.733
There should be something over there.

00:39:52.733 --> 00:39:54.600
Like this, maybe.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.200
-No... -Can you look over here for a second?

00:39:59.533 --> 00:40:02.600
Oh, right. Ayumi.

00:40:03.667 --> 00:40:06.667
Can you teach me how to make Chikuzenni?

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:10.833
No matter what I do, I can't replicate your flavor.

00:40:10.833 --> 00:40:13.200
You just have to tell me the recipe.

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:19.733
Just teach you...

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:21.367
You finally asked.

00:40:21.367 --> 00:40:24.167
Now you don't have to make Chikuzenni every day anymore.

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:32.033
Could it be this?

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.233
Ayumi-san, do you use this?

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:41.100
Dashi powder...

00:40:53.133 --> 00:40:55.633
Sorry, I'm going home.

00:40:55.933 --> 00:40:57.767
-Wait. -Ayumi-san!

00:41:08.833 --> 00:41:11.500
(Dashi Powder)

00:41:13.467 --> 00:41:16.200
Do you feel like you've been betrayed?

00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:19.067
No, it's not like that...

00:41:19.667 --> 00:41:22.967
I did see it once. When we first started living together...

00:41:22.967 --> 00:41:24.433
...I saw Ayumi making dashi from scratch.

00:41:24.433 --> 00:41:27.400
At my house, we always use dried sardines.

00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:30.067
But I thought I'd try making bonito dashi for you.

00:41:30.067 --> 00:41:31.533
That's wonderful.

00:41:33.733 --> 00:41:35.333
Wonderful.

00:41:42.533 --> 00:41:44.233
-So delicious. -Is it?

00:41:44.233 --> 00:41:46.333
-That's great. -So tasty.

00:41:46.533 --> 00:41:49.467
From now on, this will be our flavor.

00:41:53.267 --> 00:41:54.933
But it wasn't like that.

00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:58.667
I thought I knew everything.

00:42:03.067 --> 00:42:04.833
I was making her push herself...

00:42:06.333 --> 00:42:08.167
...and I didn't even notice.

00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:14.633
How pathetic.

00:42:17.733 --> 00:42:22.233
Ebihara-san, you have to tell her.

00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:12.833
Ayumi-san.

00:43:15.167 --> 00:43:16.467
Minato-san.

00:43:18.767 --> 00:43:20.233
Sorry for calling you out of the blue.

00:43:20.233 --> 00:43:23.467
Not at all, I was out anyway.

00:43:23.467 --> 00:43:26.067
I suddenly really wanted to see you.

00:43:52.767 --> 00:43:54.200
Strange...

00:43:56.367 --> 00:43:58.800
Sorry, I'm being a little weird.

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:02.667
Wait, I didn't mean to cry...

00:44:27.733 --> 00:44:29.800
-Hello. -Hello.

00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:32.933
Sorbet.

00:44:32.933 --> 00:44:34.200
So cute.

00:44:48.433 --> 00:44:52.800
I'm sorry. I took dashi powder for granted.

00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:55.133
I didn't think it was a bad thing at all.

00:44:55.133 --> 00:44:56.933
It's not your fault.

00:45:01.733 --> 00:45:03.367
I'm sorry...

00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:05.367
I'm really sorry.

00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:07.433
-Just cry it out. -I'm not crying.

00:45:07.433 --> 00:45:09.633
-It's an era where men can cry too. -I'm not crying.

00:45:10.233 --> 00:45:11.233
I'm not going to cry.

00:45:11.233 --> 00:45:14.000
-Okay, let's eat curry. -Let's eat curry.

00:45:14.733 --> 00:45:17.500
Let's eat.

00:45:27.933 --> 00:45:31.233
But no matter how times change...

00:45:31.233 --> 00:45:33.333
...curry is still best eaten together.

00:45:33.333 --> 00:45:34.700
That's right.

00:45:35.433 --> 00:45:37.000
So delicious.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.567
It's really delicious.

00:45:40.833 --> 00:45:43.567
Oh yeah, the dating app.

00:45:43.567 --> 00:45:45.567
Shrimp-Cutlet-senpai, you should start a new romance too.

00:45:45.567 --> 00:45:47.433
No, I'm not into that kind of thing...

00:45:47.433 --> 00:45:49.900
By the way, what does "Shrimp-Cutlet" mean?

00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:53.333
You won't know unless you try.

00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:55.100
I hate that face.

00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:56.900
Here, what's your type?

00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:59.167
Don't just start on your own.

00:45:59.867 --> 00:46:01.167
Next.

00:46:02.967 --> 00:46:05.033
So cute.

00:46:06.733 --> 00:46:11.567
You're even more handsome than your photo. I was so surprised.

00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:14.000
Am I?

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.567
I think I'm already falling for you.

00:46:16.567 --> 00:46:19.867

(Next Episode Preview)
What is this, oden?

00:46:20.767 --> 00:46:21.900
(A New Encounter)
Can't you just buy this at a convenience store?

00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:22.833
(A New Encounter)
What's with this guy?

00:46:22.833 --> 00:46:24.333
(A New Crush Forms)
That smile... It's not fair.

00:46:24.333 --> 00:46:27.000
(A New Crush Forms)
Because expressing yourself is the first step to understanding each other.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.000
So I was trampling on Ayumi's feelings like this every day.
