00:00:00.921 --> 00:00:03.260
I've found the star of my life.

00:00:03.303 --> 00:00:04.859
Don't run!

00:00:07.435 --> 00:00:08.264
No way...

00:00:08.715 --> 00:00:10.442
-Mr. President. -Mr. President?

00:00:10.542 --> 00:00:11.705
I'm his grandson.

00:00:11.738 --> 00:00:13.604
I will not run from my destiny.

00:00:13.604 --> 00:00:16.926
Though I am unworthy, I've decided to become your secretary.

00:00:16.943 --> 00:00:20.292
And of course, I will completely hide the fact that I'm a fan.

00:00:20.805 --> 00:00:24.360
This afternoon, there's a video conference with Clay Indy America.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.906
After that, you'll be inspecting the China branch office.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.917
You should be arriving in the evening then, right?

00:00:29.148 --> 00:00:30.278
Just to unwind...

00:00:30.286 --> 00:00:33.668
how about we have dinner at an open-air cafÃ© while gazing at the stars?

00:00:33.677 --> 00:00:36.774
Mr. President, this is a business trip.

00:00:36.915 --> 00:00:38.751
Arriving in the evening...

00:00:38.751 --> 00:00:41.341
can't we have a little dinner?

00:00:43.577 --> 00:00:45.341
I understand.

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:48.526
I will book the hotel restaurant then.

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:49.887
Great!

00:00:50.585 --> 00:00:52.239
Your tie is crooked.

00:01:10.921 --> 00:01:11.884
Morning...

00:01:11.893 --> 00:01:14.269
Morning... Good morning.

00:01:14.316 --> 00:01:15.687
Morning...

00:01:17.948 --> 00:01:20.497
What kind of romantic dream was I having this early?

00:01:21.437 --> 00:01:24.428
Well, people dream at night or in the morning.

00:01:24.428 --> 00:01:27.144
Right. I don't know what got into me.

00:01:27.144 --> 00:01:29.144
The subconscious is a scary thing.

00:01:29.386 --> 00:01:31.181
And today of all days, the president's first day in office.

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:35.200
Ugh, my face is so puffy.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.651
It's because I ate yakiniku to pump myself up yesterday.

00:01:41.497 --> 00:01:43.703
My stomach is sticking out, too.

00:01:44.559 --> 00:01:46.213
Get it together! Get it together!

00:01:48.985 --> 00:01:51.321
Actor Shun Himuro announced yesterday...

00:01:51.322 --> 00:01:54.857
that he will be the new president of the apparel trading company TAKASHIRO.

00:01:54.875 --> 00:01:57.585
The press conference was broadcast live...

00:01:57.585 --> 00:02:00.146
generating a huge amount of buzz.

00:02:00.146 --> 00:02:02.918
His transition from the entertainment industry to the business world...

00:02:02.918 --> 00:02:04.441
has left fans and the industry...

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:11.856
Minami, you're here early.

00:02:11.856 --> 00:02:13.093
Good morning.

00:02:13.205 --> 00:02:15.252
The new president is in your hands starting today.

00:02:15.262 --> 00:02:16.814
Yes, ma'am.

00:02:16.926 --> 00:02:18.795
Of course. No problem.

00:02:18.814 --> 00:02:20.964
Ugh, I'm so nervous.

00:02:20.964 --> 00:02:23.262
Minami-senpai, something's happened to the president!

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.425
How could this happen?

00:02:30.425 --> 00:02:33.749
The president of an apparel company shouldn't dress like that.

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:35.749
It's kind of embarrassing.

00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:39.506
Wow, I bet the stock price is going to plummet, not soar.

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:40.994
My idiot idol!

00:02:40.995 --> 00:02:43.962
How could he dress like this on his first day as president?

00:02:44.771 --> 00:02:45.937
Morning, everyone.

00:02:45.948 --> 00:02:47.696
Good morning, Mr. President...

00:02:51.111 --> 00:02:54.879
That's the outfit Shun wears in the currently airing drama "Rival"...

00:02:54.907 --> 00:02:58.562
No, wait, that's what Kazuki Sakuragi wears!

00:03:03.502 --> 00:03:05.829
No wonder there's a fake bloodstain.

00:03:05.857 --> 00:03:08.334
Stylist, do your job!

00:03:12.911 --> 00:03:17.481
I'm sorry. He was filming all night, so I didn't have time to take him home.

00:03:17.481 --> 00:03:20.784
I was going to borrow the president character's costume from the stylist...

00:03:20.784 --> 00:03:22.484
...but it had already been returned.

00:03:22.512 --> 00:03:24.924
I borrowed a jacket for him as a last resort.

00:03:25.313 --> 00:03:27.313
I've already sent someone to get a suit.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.337
There's no time. I'll take care of it here.

00:03:30.348 --> 00:03:31.552
Um...

00:03:32.036 --> 00:03:33.428
Good morning, everyone.

00:03:33.447 --> 00:03:35.662
Good morning...

00:03:35.951 --> 00:03:37.635
Please come this way. Excuse me...

00:03:37.645 --> 00:03:38.771
Wait...

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.844
My fave is in a crisis!

00:04:44.632 --> 00:04:48.301
(My Fave is My Boss: Full Throttle)

00:04:51.751 --> 00:04:54.888
Luckily, the suit samples just arrived.

00:04:55.827 --> 00:04:57.885
But still, for the first day...

00:04:58.232 --> 00:04:59.811
-We should go. -Right.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.465
Alright.

00:05:03.214 --> 00:05:06.827
Please choose a suit you like from these.

00:05:06.885 --> 00:05:10.583
To be efficient, I will now brief you on today's schedule.

00:05:10.583 --> 00:05:12.179
I've already emailed everything to you.

00:05:13.062 --> 00:05:15.687
First, we will visit the apparel manufacturer, Asagiri Corporation.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.955
We'll greet them and confirm the contract details.

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:22.759
Asagiri Corporation... They were close with the former president, weren't they?

00:05:22.802 --> 00:05:25.148
President Asagiri has retired.

00:05:25.148 --> 00:05:28.026
His grandson, Ao, has taken over...

00:05:35.546 --> 00:05:38.801
I'm seeing something with my own eyes that's usually only on the members-only site.

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.462
...taken over as the Representative Director.

00:05:49.709 --> 00:05:52.925
President Ao is also a popular YouTuber.

00:05:52.941 --> 00:05:55.529
He currently has over a million subscribers.

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:57.312
The shoes are over there.

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:58.799
Okay.

00:05:59.869 --> 00:06:01.811
Amazing.

00:06:13.307 --> 00:06:17.572
His taste in suits and the tie he paired it with are perfect.

00:06:17.572 --> 00:06:19.557
He really is a genius.

00:06:20.512 --> 00:06:22.091
This pose is...

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:26.977
It's the same composition as a photo in Shun's concept photobook, "After Work."

00:06:26.981 --> 00:06:29.590
The theme was the process from an office worker coming home until bedtime.

00:06:29.593 --> 00:06:31.593
It charmed so many fans.

00:06:31.607 --> 00:06:34.216
Shun in a suit, loosening his tie...

00:06:34.228 --> 00:06:37.088
...taking off his clothes, playing with his dog, wearing a white knit sweater...

00:06:37.088 --> 00:06:39.983
...cooking dinner, taking a bath, sleeping with his dog.

00:06:39.984 --> 00:06:42.572
There were even sexy moments from the dog's point of view interspersed throughout.

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:47.311
It's a super-valuable, must-have item for fans, full of precious photos.

00:06:47.331 --> 00:06:49.752
Alright, let's go.

00:06:50.865 --> 00:06:52.043
Yes, sir.

00:07:00.257 --> 00:07:02.838
He's so good at tying ties during shoots.

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:05.712
I've discovered something Shun is bad at.

00:07:05.792 --> 00:07:08.398
And it's the same as the Chairman.

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:11.153
Grandfather and grandson, indeed.

00:07:16.302 --> 00:07:19.331
Mr. President, your tie is a little crooked.

00:07:20.909 --> 00:07:22.177
Where?

00:07:31.696 --> 00:07:33.696
S-Sorry.

00:07:33.754 --> 00:07:36.226
The stylist usually handles this for me.

00:07:36.284 --> 00:07:37.694
I wasn't paying attention...

00:07:38.117 --> 00:07:41.969
I'll find a male employee to help you shortly.

00:07:50.424 --> 00:07:54.816
My heart is going to explode today!

00:08:04.438 --> 00:08:06.254
Why are there only female employees?

00:08:07.181 --> 00:08:10.419
We should run into a male employee on the way.

00:08:10.442 --> 00:08:12.362
We're out of time. Let's just go.

00:08:13.231 --> 00:08:14.545
Okay.

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:16.626
Not a single man in sight.

00:08:16.626 --> 00:08:20.412
I don't see any male employees. Is our company predominantly female?

00:08:22.844 --> 00:08:24.832
This is a problem.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.216
The driver must know how to tie a tie.

00:08:29.663 --> 00:08:32.836
Excuse me, could you help the president adjust his tie?

00:08:32.847 --> 00:08:35.882
I'm sorry, I don't know how to tie one.

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:43.176
Damn it. What should I do?

00:08:43.897 --> 00:08:45.319
Um...

00:08:46.462 --> 00:08:48.531
I know this might be a bit like sexual harassment...

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.212
but just for today, could you help me?

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:55.688
Of course. It's my job.

00:08:56.261 --> 00:09:00.308
The president of an apparel trading company must have a perfectly tied tie.

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:05.730
My hands won't stop shaking.

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:08.995
What do I do? My fave is going to think it's weird.

00:09:09.258 --> 00:09:10.844
Get a grip!

00:09:10.947 --> 00:09:12.602
Ms. Minami?

00:09:12.613 --> 00:09:13.824
Yes?

00:09:24.614 --> 00:09:25.912
Is something wrong?

00:09:26.472 --> 00:09:29.101
I was just about to help the president with his tie.

00:09:29.101 --> 00:09:30.825
Allow me.

00:09:31.431 --> 00:09:33.362
My apologies.

00:09:35.507 --> 00:09:36.953
-There you go. -Thanks.

00:09:36.976 --> 00:09:40.200
Mr. President, good luck on your first day of work.

00:09:40.224 --> 00:09:42.166
-Do your best. -I will.

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:44.663
Let's go.

00:09:46.573 --> 00:09:50.448
I thought some couple was kissing in broad daylight in front of the company.

00:09:50.517 --> 00:09:52.540
I was shocked when I saw it was you two.

00:09:52.563 --> 00:09:55.035
Don't be ridiculous. This is official business.

00:09:56.259 --> 00:09:57.866
Ms. Minami.

00:09:59.628 --> 00:10:03.494
My fave is asking me to sit next to him?

00:10:07.083 --> 00:10:08.257
Yes.

00:10:16.335 --> 00:10:19.138
I can't believe I get to sit next to my fave.

00:10:19.195 --> 00:10:23.636
Oh, gods. What good deeds did I do to deserve this?

00:10:23.681 --> 00:10:26.239
But I can't stand being this close!

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:28.977
Why did I have to eat meat yesterday?

00:10:28.984 --> 00:10:30.539
I'm such an idiot.

00:10:30.568 --> 00:10:33.105
Do you have a copy of today's contract?

00:10:33.105 --> 00:10:34.208
Yes, I do.

00:10:35.604 --> 00:10:37.454
Excuse me.

00:10:42.333 --> 00:10:43.989
-Here it is. -Thank you.

00:10:45.708 --> 00:10:48.817
I'm the secretary, my fave is the president.

00:10:48.829 --> 00:10:50.702
No, wait. The president is the president.

00:10:50.702 --> 00:10:53.496
I need to separate the president from my fave right now.

00:10:56.482 --> 00:10:59.344
(Representative Director Ao Asagiri)
I watch all your online videos, you know.

00:10:59.344 --> 00:11:01.195
Thank you, Ms. Minami.

00:11:01.195 --> 00:11:04.870
(Asagiri Holdings Inc. Ao Asagiri)
I'm glad you're still the president's secretary.

00:11:04.911 --> 00:11:06.669
Long time no see.

00:11:06.669 --> 00:11:10.144
The Chairman also very much wanted to visit you in person.

00:11:10.144 --> 00:11:14.972
The Chairman has truly taken great care of me.

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:17.956
We are the ones who are indebted to him.

00:11:17.956 --> 00:11:19.956
You're having a hard time, too.

00:11:19.956 --> 00:11:22.769
Suddenly becoming president of an unfamiliar industry.

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:27.201
But you don't need to worry. You have a very excellent secretary.

00:11:27.298 --> 00:11:29.307
You flatter me.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:30.998
Not at all.

00:11:31.685 --> 00:11:35.869
And you also have that Mr. Nikaido, the Senior Managing Director.

00:11:35.892 --> 00:11:39.447
So, you juggling being an actor and a president...

00:11:39.459 --> 00:11:40.956
will surely be no problem.

00:11:41.081 --> 00:11:42.200
I'll do my best.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:43.993
-Keep it up. -Yes.

00:11:44.004 --> 00:11:45.233
Oh, right.

00:11:45.245 --> 00:11:49.833
My character's name in the drama is the same as Mr. Shun's.

00:11:49.849 --> 00:11:51.228
We're both named Ao.

00:11:51.228 --> 00:11:53.480
-A pleasure to work with you. -Likewise.

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.778
What a coincidence.

00:11:55.167 --> 00:11:57.221
By the way, later...

00:11:57.247 --> 00:12:00.002
could I take a photo and a short video with you?

00:12:02.359 --> 00:12:05.647
I want to upload it to my social media.

00:12:05.671 --> 00:12:07.806
It could boost the company's image.

00:12:08.122 --> 00:12:10.301
-Well... -My sincerest apologies.

00:12:10.301 --> 00:12:14.011
He has contracts with advertisement sponsors, so it might not be convenient.

00:12:14.011 --> 00:12:16.915
That makes sense.

00:12:17.915 --> 00:12:19.670
By the way, Ms. Minami...

00:12:19.737 --> 00:12:24.058
now you get to be with a handsome actor all the time.

00:12:24.122 --> 00:12:26.122
-Not really. -I'm so jealous.

00:12:27.158 --> 00:12:31.097
-Shall we start confirming the final version of the contract? -Yes.

00:12:31.113 --> 00:12:33.500
-Thank you. -Not at all.

00:12:45.669 --> 00:12:48.450
The president has a shoot this afternoon, doesn't he?

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:52.260
Where's Mr. Usui?

00:13:00.715 --> 00:13:05.313
I can't make it today. I have to go turn down that endorsement deal.

00:13:05.473 --> 00:13:06.876
The key.

00:13:06.988 --> 00:13:10.143
Thanks. But you don't have to come with me.

00:13:10.168 --> 00:13:14.041
It's the last day of shooting.

00:13:15.626 --> 00:13:17.626
Ms. Minami.

00:13:24.255 --> 00:13:27.626
(Actor Haru Shiraishi)
Hey, President Takashiro. I saw the news.

00:13:27.855 --> 00:13:29.064
Stop messing with me.

00:13:29.064 --> 00:13:31.855
It's Haru Shiraishi, who plays his love interest.

00:13:31.967 --> 00:13:33.773
So they're close.

00:13:34.478 --> 00:13:36.189
Who is she?

00:13:36.429 --> 00:13:39.686
The company's secretary. She's filling in for my manager today.

00:13:41.207 --> 00:13:44.401
Hey, are you really quitting acting?

00:13:48.916 --> 00:13:52.148
Ready... Action!

00:14:13.797 --> 00:14:15.539
Sara.

00:14:16.068 --> 00:14:17.874
Come here.

00:14:26.088 --> 00:14:27.991
Cut!

00:14:30.746 --> 00:14:32.359
Good work.

00:14:32.359 --> 00:14:34.199
Thank you.

00:14:35.816 --> 00:14:37.668
You seem quite used to this sort of thing.

00:14:40.038 --> 00:14:43.730
As a secretary, I should understand what the president is feeling.

00:14:45.473 --> 00:14:47.077
The director wants to see you.

00:14:47.077 --> 00:14:48.434
Got it.

00:14:53.531 --> 00:14:56.263
So you're Shun's secretary.

00:14:57.177 --> 00:14:59.177
You seem to know your way around a film set.

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:00.589
Not really.

00:15:00.589 --> 00:15:02.157
You're not a fan, are you?

00:15:02.273 --> 00:15:04.656
No. I'm just doing my job.

00:15:04.705 --> 00:15:07.197
Really?

00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:10.279
Being with someone as amazing as Shun all day...

00:15:10.294 --> 00:15:12.283
how could you not fall in love with him?

00:15:12.673 --> 00:15:14.673
You're absolutely right.

00:15:15.007 --> 00:15:17.377
See? You just wavered for a second.

00:15:17.447 --> 00:15:19.238
I can tell.

00:15:19.252 --> 00:15:21.673
Because I've seen a lot of people like that.

00:15:22.902 --> 00:15:25.348
What do you mean by "a lot"?

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:27.419
Co-stars, for example.

00:15:27.419 --> 00:15:30.791
Shun and his co-stars?

00:15:30.887 --> 00:15:32.627
Impossible.

00:15:32.655 --> 00:15:34.655
But Shun never paid them any mind.

00:15:36.888 --> 00:15:39.309
See? You just breathed a sigh of relief.

00:15:39.309 --> 00:15:40.928
You are a fan, aren't you?

00:15:40.928 --> 00:15:42.115
I am not.

00:15:42.115 --> 00:15:43.921
No, you're suspicious.

00:15:43.931 --> 00:15:45.293
I told you I'm not.

00:15:45.329 --> 00:15:49.288
I was chosen as the president's secretary precisely because I'm not interested in celebrities.

00:15:49.306 --> 00:15:50.812
If I have time to watch TV...

00:15:50.812 --> 00:15:53.003
I'd rather work on self-improvement for my future.

00:15:54.127 --> 00:15:55.413
Did you hear that?

00:16:00.363 --> 00:16:01.631
Thank you.

00:16:06.163 --> 00:16:08.676
I've messed up again.

00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:16.683
Fate can be so cruel.

00:16:17.118 --> 00:16:19.118
To think they were enemies.

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:40.863
Let go of me!

00:16:42.053 --> 00:16:43.615
I won't.

00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:50.572
This might be Shun's last performance.

00:16:51.874 --> 00:16:54.277
Cut! Okay!

00:16:56.448 --> 00:16:58.448
With that scene...

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:00.399
Mr. Shun Himuro has officially wrapped filming!

00:17:00.432 --> 00:17:02.253
-Good work! -Thank you, everyone!

00:17:02.596 --> 00:17:05.353
Shun, great job!

00:17:05.458 --> 00:17:07.660
-Thank you, everyone. -Good work.

00:17:09.928 --> 00:17:12.782
What must Shun be feeling right now?

00:17:20.181 --> 00:17:22.085
I'm so deceitful.

00:17:22.568 --> 00:17:25.293
I say it's to be a help to him...

00:17:25.293 --> 00:17:27.959
...but I'm hiding the fact that I'm a superfan while being his secretary.

00:17:27.959 --> 00:17:30.103
And I got to witness this special moment.

00:17:30.247 --> 00:17:34.100
At the same time, I'm secretly happy to be here right now.

00:17:34.197 --> 00:17:37.763
This feeling of happiness... I feel like I'll be punished for it one day.

00:17:38.181 --> 00:17:40.745
If that's the case, then until that day comes...

00:17:40.793 --> 00:17:44.388
...I will work with all my heart for President Shun.

00:17:54.955 --> 00:17:58.759
This might be the last time I see this gentle side of Shun with his fans.

00:18:09.887 --> 00:18:11.535
Shun!

00:18:12.081 --> 00:18:14.017
Why are you quitting showbiz?

00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:15.711
Don't quit!

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:18.194
Be our star forever!

00:18:18.226 --> 00:18:20.226
Be our light forever!

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:23.416
Light?

00:18:26.504 --> 00:18:30.485
Thank you very much for feeling that way.

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:39.350
Unauthorized personnel are not allowed here.

00:18:39.784 --> 00:18:41.752
Sorry.

00:18:45.848 --> 00:18:47.169
Let's go.

00:18:47.623 --> 00:18:49.156
Mr. President.

00:18:51.761 --> 00:18:55.551
Are you really going to give up your acting career?

00:19:00.521 --> 00:19:04.776
Although I don't know much about the entertainment world...

00:19:05.452 --> 00:19:07.907
in this world...

00:19:08.132 --> 00:19:10.749
there are surely many people who need you.

00:19:12.454 --> 00:19:16.959
And many people who feel happy because of you.

00:19:17.919 --> 00:19:19.971
Ms. Minami.

00:19:21.631 --> 00:19:24.499
With that attitude, you're not qualified to be the president's secretary.

00:19:26.872 --> 00:19:28.872
I'm sorry.

00:19:53.608 --> 00:19:56.816
Don't quit. You have to be our star forever.

00:19:56.848 --> 00:19:58.848
Be our light forever.

00:20:33.607 --> 00:20:35.359
Excuse me.

00:20:36.593 --> 00:20:39.067
I've made you some tea.

00:20:46.716 --> 00:20:48.170
Thanks.

00:20:55.008 --> 00:20:56.521
Mr. President.

00:20:57.978 --> 00:21:00.540
I'm very sorry about earlier.

00:21:02.085 --> 00:21:04.597
You've made up your mind to be the president...

00:21:04.597 --> 00:21:06.082
and yet I...

00:21:09.943 --> 00:21:12.255
-Ms. Minami. -Yes?

00:21:15.071 --> 00:21:16.946
President Asagiri...

00:21:18.279 --> 00:21:20.279
he seems to trust you a great deal.

00:21:20.939 --> 00:21:24.119
That's just a pleasantry. It's not true.

00:21:24.605 --> 00:21:26.965
In his eyes, I'm just a celebrity.

00:21:29.195 --> 00:21:31.986
Some people only see me as a figurehead for publicity.

00:21:32.684 --> 00:21:35.230
I can understand that.

00:21:36.588 --> 00:21:39.237
I'm not yet worthy of being a president.

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:42.309
Right now, I'd rather not use my celebrity status as a selling point.

00:21:43.742 --> 00:21:46.378
I know I'm being narrow-minded.

00:21:49.591 --> 00:21:53.712
For the time being, I will play the role of "president."

00:21:57.724 --> 00:21:59.724
I'll play the president...

00:22:00.447 --> 00:22:05.342
so that the employees feel they can confidently follow me.

00:22:06.189 --> 00:22:08.040
And then, one day...

00:22:08.837 --> 00:22:12.534
I hope to become a president they genuinely want to follow.

00:22:19.012 --> 00:22:23.856
Why are you telling me all this?

00:22:26.681 --> 00:22:29.524
Because you're my secretary.

00:22:30.608 --> 00:22:33.910
Didn't he say I was unqualified?

00:22:36.476 --> 00:22:38.302
Within the company...

00:22:38.812 --> 00:22:43.128
you are the only one who truly recognizes me as an actor.

00:22:43.161 --> 00:22:44.913
-That's not true. -It is.

00:22:47.803 --> 00:22:50.113
You are unqualified to be the president's secretary.

00:22:50.474 --> 00:22:52.037
But...

00:22:53.295 --> 00:22:55.481
you are qualified to be my secretary.

00:23:00.775 --> 00:23:04.326
I'll be counting on you starting tomorrow.

00:23:07.141 --> 00:23:08.943
Of course.

00:23:21.112 --> 00:23:23.639
My fave's head is resting on my shoulder.

00:23:25.071 --> 00:23:27.989
Is this a dream or reality?

00:23:36.658 --> 00:23:41.043
How did I mess up again?!

00:24:42.746 --> 00:24:44.746
Subtitle by MkvDama

00:24:45.397 --> 00:24:46.169
So dazzling!

00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:48.497
(Idol Secretary in Ecstasy)
Isn't that from the 2020 stage play "Prince of Versailles"?

00:24:48.578 --> 00:24:50.965
I keep my work as president and as an actor completely separate.

00:24:50.965 --> 00:24:53.254
(Fave Faces Another Crisis)
Why not use your status as an actor?

00:24:53.262 --> 00:24:55.740
Time is up. We'll end it here.

00:24:55.776 --> 00:24:57.398
I can't believe I got to see him with wet hair.

00:24:57.398 --> 00:24:59.512
Can I really watch this for free?
