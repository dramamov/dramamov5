WEBVTT

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.920
[Danger]

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.560
How could the Tang army react so quickly?

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.290
Where is my headache medicine?

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.080
Nongyu.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.700
Master.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.930
You sent Nongyu to catch the spies.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.840
Jieniu.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.160
Li Ling.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.220
Master.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.640
None of them have returned yet.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.960
Go

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.400
and bring them back to me.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.410
The situation in Chang'an is about to change.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.960
What's the use of catching a few spies?

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:14.920
Hurry up!

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.360
Yes.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.759
Nongyu

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.360
You're awake.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.570
It's still snowing.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.650
Here.

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:45.440
Put this on quickly so you don't catch cold.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.640
Li Ling

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:55.170
I've made up my mind.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.440
From today on,

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.940
there will be no more secrets between us.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:00.980
Listen carefully.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.760
My real name is Feng Yinniang.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.600
My father was General Feng Jianye of the Great Tang.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.320
Li Ling.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.440
Li Ling.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.640
Go ahead, do it.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.280
General Feng.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.600
You're Feng Jianye's daughter.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.120
You know him?

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.040
I don't know him personally.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.880
I...

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.579
I've only heard of him.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.560
General Feng's entire life,

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.440
he was skilled in both civil and military affairs,

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.300
utterly loyal,

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.320
defeated the Jieshi,

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.579
conquered the DabolÃ¼,

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.360
achieved glorious military victories throughout his life,

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.960
and rarely suffered defeat.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.240
He's someone I admire most.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.290
Rarely suffered defeat...

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.480
Yes.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.200
My father's greatest defeat

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.520
was being betrayed by that traitor.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.380
The rebel An took advantage and captured Tongguan.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.640
The court didn't investigate thoroughly,

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.240
but falsely accused my father of treason,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.440
ordered his execution,

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.900
and condemned our entire family.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.720
My father served Tang loyally his whole life,

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.120
with absolute devotion,

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.280
yet this was his fate.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.840
How could his spirit ever rest in peace?

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.400
My poor mother

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.329
and my fourteen-year-old brother

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.960
were hacked to death

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.160
by countless blades.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.640
Perhaps heaven took pity on me,

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.640
I escaped death

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.240
and survived.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.010
Loneliness,

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.240
despair,

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.480
fear,

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:50.560
the darkest nights,

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.320
the bitterest medicine,

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.920
the most unbearable nights,

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.170
I survived them all.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.690
The Feng Yinniang standing before you now

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.200
may be covered in wounds,

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.640
but is also unbreakable.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:08.960
I will definitely find

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.520
my father's true murderer.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.400
I will have him sliced into pieces

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.460
and torn to shreds.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.290
To avenge my mother,

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.960
my father,

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.120
and Xiaochuan.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.600
I already have a lead.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.200
I found my father's precious sword,

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.880
Yu Linxun.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.840
Yu Linxun is known as the world's most extraordinary blade.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.600
My father loved it dearly and never parted with it.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.240
This time,

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.900
it somehow ended up in Su Changming's hands.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.080
There must be something suspicious about this.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.120
I joined the Guantian Society

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.240
and entered the Chen household

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.360
because I had an agreement with Su Changming.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.360
Once I obtain the Night Firefly Painting,

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.159
he will tell me

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.440
who really killed my father.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:53.520
I understand.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.280
This is undoubtedly like asking a tiger for its skin.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.010
I know you're worried about me.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.450
I've made up my mind now.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.080
I'm with you.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.840
From now on, your path is my path.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.930
Just as you said,

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.040
it's not just for the people,

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.960
but also for us.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.650
I will do everything in my power

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.640
to help you reclaim the Tang Dynasty

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.900
and restore Chang'an.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.040
Yu Linxun.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.040
Stop right there.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.800
You touched my sword.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.360
Forgive me, General.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.600
I don't know what came over me.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.680
I was momentarily possessed

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.540
and defiled your precious sword.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:21.360
Boy,

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.640
I've been watching you for a long time.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.320
You've had your eye on my sword

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.200
for quite some time now.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.360
Do you know how to use a sword?

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.290
I wouldn't dare.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:31.700
Show me a few moves.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.080
Do you know why it's called Yu Linxun?

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.520
Those who master blades prevail

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.620
because of their unyielding spirit.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.360
Since you admire it,

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.020
you should at least

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.159
have the courage worthy of such admiration.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:53.120
Take it.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:54.720
Stand up.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.520
Having no will to win

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:17.280
is no different from surrender.

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.160
Your strikes are hesitant and indecisive.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:19.600
Again.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.160
I'm standing before you now.

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.640
I am your enemy.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:24.960
Boy,

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.200
use whatever skills you have.

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.080
How is this possible?

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.800
You must be wondering,

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.320
even though you used all your strength,

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:47.520
how Yu Linxun

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.460
could be knocked away with just one move.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:52.659
Remember this:

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:54.720
A true sword

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:56.740
is not in your hand,

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.360
but here

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:00.880
and here.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.600
As long as you put your whole heart

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.200
into the blade,

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.160
truly clear your mind of distractions

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.180
and become one with the sword,

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.560
any sword in this world

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.080
can be called Yu Linxun.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:20.560
Boy,

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.200
what's your name?

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.640
What's your position in the army?

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.880
In response to the General,

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:28.810
my elder brother

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:30.580
was a deserter.

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.080
I was demoted to become a Buliangren,

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.480
unworthy of a name in the army.

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:37.320
I am...

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:39.570
a stable boy.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.520
Then you've been taking care

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.420
of my Zhaoyebai very well.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.410
Let me tell you a secret.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.480
When I was serving

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.600
the General of the Imperial Guards,

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.760
I not only fixed horseshoes

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.200
but also picked up horse dung.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.800
It stank terribly!

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.000
Boy, remember this:

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:02.360
In life,

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.160
what you become

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.440
is not determined by your birth.

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.360
It's not for others to decide.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:12.480
It's always in your own hands.

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:19.640
Good kid.

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:21.320
Now,

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.640
you should tell me your name.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.440
My name is Li Ling.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.090
You're from Guantian Society.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.320
This area outside the city is so desolate.

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.320
I'm afraid food will be hard to find.

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.450
What a gentle voice.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.040
Could she be waiting for a lover?

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:11.570
Why is it you?

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:14.420
What's with that expression?

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.040
The lover you're waiting for,

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:17.880
isn't it me?

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.000
Nongyu, oh Nongyu.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:28.960
Until today,

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.720
we haven't seen each other for three whole months.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:35.890
I thought you would miss me.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:41.090
But instead, you've come up with something quite original.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.120
Giving me such a grand welcome gift.

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:46.320
Give it back to me.

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.240
Why don't you tell me,

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:51.960
how it feels to use the sky as your blanket

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.680
and the ground as your bed?

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:56.810
I don't recall giving you such an assignment.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.880
My affairs are none of your business.

00:10:58.880 --> 00:10:59.880
Don't forget you belong to Guantian Society,

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.540
you are mine, Su Changming's.

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:03.560
I've been going crazy with restraint,

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:05.360
haven't even dared to touch you.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.810
Yet you're out here looking for other men.

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.680
So the great young master of Guantian Society

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:17.210
only knows how to use force.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.560
And you kept saying

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.580
you would win my heart and make me willingly submit.

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:23.120
Is this your method?

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.140
Who is that man anyway?

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.480
Who is it?

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.600
Stop right there!

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.050
What's going on?

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:36.700
Nongyu.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:38.720
Li Ling.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:39.880
Yin Niang.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.370
Are you alright?

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.000
I was wondering who it might be.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.600
So it's an old acquaintance.

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.120
Meeting an old friend in a foreign land.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:51.720
What a wonderful coincidence!

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:52.050
Come,

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.050
give me a hug.

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.770
Li Ling, you'll never catch me!

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:01.400
I'm a soldier, you're a bandit.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.260
We have no friendship between us.

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:06.120
See that?

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:08.680
So heartless.

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.720
Your taste in men is terrible.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:12.760
You!

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:18.120
Years ago, I spared your life by luck,

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:20.440
which was already a great mercy.

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.080
I never expected that not only would you not repent,

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.210
but you'd become even more shameless.

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.020
My level of shamelessness

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.010
certainly can't compare to yours.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.040
I've heard that

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:33.060
one moment you were a Tang army foot soldier,

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.960
and the next you became Chen Jingbian's watchdog.

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:38.240
Nongyu,

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.280
this man changes sides faster than turning pages.

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:42.800
He's clearly a heartless man.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.930
It's not too late for you to regret now.

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:19.360
Xie Zheng

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:20.920
Kang Rui

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:21.200
Zhi Rui

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:21.930
Kang Sun Wang

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:24.240
Ying

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:24.880
Wang Lin Wang

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:25.200
Wang Lin

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:25.960
Ying Lu
Wang Lin Wang

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:28.080
Tong Liu

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.040
Hao Xiao

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:36.360
Li Li Zhang

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:47.360
Liu Wang
Jia Jianing Tao Jiaying Xi Dourong

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.080
Jia Jianing Tao Jiaying

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.540
Jia Jianing Tao Jiaying Xi Dourong Jingshou

00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:58.920
Assistant.

00:13:58.920 --> 00:13:59.800
Assistant.

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.960
Li Sheng Lanfeng Tao.

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:02.520
Sheng Lanfeng Tao.
