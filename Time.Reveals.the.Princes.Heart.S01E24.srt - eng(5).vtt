WEBVTT

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.360
So you're the one who drove my mother to suicide.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.680
You bastard.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.520
My father thought you were loyal to him.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.160
He always treated you like a brother.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.960
Why did you

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.280
do this?

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.520
Silin.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.880
Don't hurt Silin.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.440
Silin.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.960
You don't know yet, do you?

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.440
I convinced your father to place this woman

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.240
by your side.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.680
Unfortunately, this woman

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.800
is useless.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.050
She actually fell in love with you.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.280
This useless thing.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.640
Qianfan, you.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.440
Anyone who is troubled by love

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.280
will never achieve greatness.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.759
And you, Liu Silin,

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.420
are exactly such a person.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.120
No!

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.920
Don't hurt Silin!

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.280
Liu Muzhi.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.960
Open your eyes and see.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.640
Your glorious young master

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.120
The eldest son is now under my foot.

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.800
Your second son.

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:51.600
I killed him too.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.039
You treated me like a servant.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.720
Treated me like a servant.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.720
I've been a damn servant my whole life.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.720
I've had enough.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.400
Now I want to be the master.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.039
Qianfan.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.360
Don't celebrate too soon.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.680
If you just

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.720
gently

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:26.040
put your fingerprint on this,

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.680
voluntarily giving up

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.440
all the Liu family's property and restaurant shares,

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.000
you'll be free.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I'll also

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.040
spare you and Yiyu.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.920
The young master just said

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.520
that all shares and property

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.560
would be given to me.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.720
Did you all hear that?

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.520
I heard that.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.000
No!

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.720
Don't hurt Silin!

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.640
From now on,

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.560
the Liu family belongs to me.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.200
From now on, the Liu family will be surnamed Qian.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.440
I've finally made it.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.560
I've finally succeeded.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.720
I've finally endured it all.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.800
Don't celebrate too soon.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.200
Look.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.920
What is this?

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.920
Back then,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.880
you went to great lengths

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.920
to kill Yiyu's parents.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.920
Wasn't it all for what's inside this box?

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.360
Where is it?

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.560
Where did you get this?

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.440
Everyone, put all these books and papers in a well-ventilated place

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.560
to prevent moisture damage.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.160
Also put them where mice can't reach them,

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.360
so they can be preserved longer.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.080
Did you hear me?

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.560
Yes.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.560
Could your father have hidden it?

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:38.280
My father?

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.640
Fulu Restaurant.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.080
Young master.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.480
We've searched the entire restaurant

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.600
but found no box.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.320
This cellar is built with special stones

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.360
to keep it cool and dry.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.220
It's where the kitchen stores vegetables and meat.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.620
Caiyue, follow me.

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.160
Young Master.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.970
There's an important document in the box.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.600
Master Jiang wanted to preserve it for a long time,

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.330
so he might have hidden it here.

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.920
Found it!

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:35.280
It really is here.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.440
Where's the stuff?

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.040
I released Yiyu.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.720
I let her go.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.080
You released her?

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:28.960
You let her go?

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:33.280
Yiyu.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.200
Silin.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.159
Silin.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.200
Yiyu.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.760
Do you know what's in the box?

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.290
It contains all the evidence of Qianfan's crimes

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.600
over all these years.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.600
You trafficked tobacco,

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.560
human trafficking, murder and robbery.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.820
You did all these terrible things behind my father's back.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.200
You sweet-talked my mother

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.600
probably just to use her

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.600
to cover up your crimes.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.280
And the reason my mother committed suicide

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:19.760
was because she found out what you had done.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.320
She felt she had betrayed my father.

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.040
Liu Silin, that's enough.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.360
Silin.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.760
Where is it?

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.880
Give it to him, Silin.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.080
Give it to me.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.880
You really are

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.440
scheming your whole life

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.100
but foolish at this critical moment.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.040
Something this important,

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.820
how could I possibly carry it with me?

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.200
I already had Caiyue

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.159
deliver it to the police station.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:53.560
You and I.

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:17.720
Silin.

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.200
Silin, how are you? Silin!

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:21.760
Yiyu.

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:24.040
You're okay.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.200
That's

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:26.880
good.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.640
Silin! Silin!

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:30.640
Wake up!

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:31.600
Silin!

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.440
Silin!

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:36.760
Silin, open your eyes and look at me!

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.600
Silin!

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:52.770
Search everywhere!

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.040
Silin!

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.160
Open your eyes and look at me.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.000
Open your eyes, Silin.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:11.800
Go in and search.

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:12.600
Yes.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:14.890
Stop shaking me.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:18.700
If you keep shaking me, you'll really shake me to death.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.500
Fortunately, I didn't come too late.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.340
Thank you, Director Wang.

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:28.080
I thought you had taken Qianfan's bribe

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.200
and wouldn't come.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:29.880
Nonsense.

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.640
Do I look like those corrupt officials?

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.760
I swear to follow General Wu until death

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.840
and fight against evil at all costs.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.900
Actually, the reason I let you go that day

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.380
was because I secretly investigated

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:51.320
and found Liu Sinan was the one trafficking opium.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.000
I just never expected

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:56.500
that Qianfan was the real mastermind behind it all.

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:00.200
So what was the document

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.040
Miss Xu used to threaten you?

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.640
It was nothing, just a photo.

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:06.440
A photo?

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:09.960
Once,

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.440
Commander Xu

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.810
took me to Yihong House for drinks.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:15.880
I got drunk that day,

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:18.080
and he took a photo

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.420
that he's been using to blackmail me ever since.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:22.760
Director Wang,

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.880
you really are a man of passion.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:03.050
That's nice.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.640
It's all over now.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:07.200
Yes.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:08.840
It's all behind us.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.200
Do you remember

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:14.500
how you looked on our wedding day?

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:18.930
It hurts so much.

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:21.840
Isn't it better yet?

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.010
Yiyu, what's wrong?

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:57.160
Your little crazy one is coming.

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:30.280
Yu.
