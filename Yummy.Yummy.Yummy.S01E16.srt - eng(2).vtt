00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.700
(Start Near to Go Far)

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:55.910
Why are you still here?

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.630
I've been working all day.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.830
I'm tired.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.520
Tired?

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.190
If so, go sleep at the diner.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:14.550
Fengxia.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.430
Can we stop this?

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.710
Let me sleep here.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.360
That diner is

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.990
cold and quiet.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.150
Moreover, it's not warm

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.360
without you.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.270
Dear.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:44.830
You want to sleep here, huh?

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.150
Fine.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.150
Really?

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.430
I have two conditions.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:50.590
Go ahead.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.030
Give me all your money from now on,

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.590
and I'll give you 10 qian every month.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.150
Besides,

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:57.480
if you ever show off

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.400
because of your chef titles,

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:00.750
I'll dock your pay.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.240
You'll only give me 10 qian,

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.400
and you'll dock my pay?

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.520
This is outrageous.

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.640
Our diner is doing so well.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.120
Ten qian is too little.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.430
Can I have a little more?

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:13.990
If you don't agree,

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.270
I won't force you.

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.590
We'll just stick to the tradition

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:18.480
and split

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.830
the profits evenly.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.080
You can go to sleep at the diner.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:23.760
I...

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:26.200
I don't want to sleep at the diner.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.400
It's getting late.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.800
Go and sleep.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.030
I'm not sleepy.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.990
Go, go.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.120
Just 10 qian.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.480
This is too little.

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:39.640
Bye.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.240
It's too little.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.080
Young Master.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.040
Young Master.

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.870
I've searched everywhere for you.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.960
What's going on?

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.200
Why are you sneaking

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.270
into Lady Shen's chamber so late?

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:56.270
Nonsense.

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.360
I came to ask her about the Prince.

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.080
I need to find out

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.120
what he told Uncle Shen

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.200
behind my back.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.080
This is urgent.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.740
A messenger from Chengzhou is here,

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.360
reporting a tragedy of 32 deaths.

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.680
Chengzhou used to be
under your jurisdiction.

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:11.800
You should go and see.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.200
The messenger is waiting outside.

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.830
Let's go.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.910
Milady.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.800
You invited me here to keep you company.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.050
Is there something on your mind?

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.380
Do you want to talk?

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.840
I can't understand why Prince Zhao

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.510
insists on sending us to Sushui City.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:51.920
Prince Zhao?

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:53.310
It's not about Mr. Lin?

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.920
I saw you two

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:55.840
doing that

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.160
in the carriage today.

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:58.040
What do you mean?

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.240
We did nothing.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.630
I saw everything.

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:01.680
No, no.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.600
You're mistaken.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.550
I have the utmost respect for Mr. Lin.

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:05.690
I regard him as an ancestor,

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:06.780
a deity.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.360
Don't say such blasphemous words.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.720
I might be struck by lightning.

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:17.950
I'm thinking about Prince Zhao.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.380
If he simply thinks

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.340
we're a burden to Mr. Lin,

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.340
why not just give us money?

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:25.860
Why dangle the carrot of Sushui City,

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.460
as if we have to go there?

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:30.620
Am I oversimplifying

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.020
the relationship between him
and Mr. Lin?

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:34.740
Is he going

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.460
to hold us hostage?

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.620
(Gentle and Calm)

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.060
Mr. Lin.

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:01.540
Mr. Lin?

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:04.700
The study is dark,

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:05.940
and he's not in the bedroom.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.340
Where else could he be?

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:10.700
Perhaps he has official business.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.260
Doesn't he often go
to the Prefecture at night?

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.100
Let's come back tomorrow.

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:19.620
Let's go.

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.420
(Capital Prefecture)

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:23.500
Mr. Lin left for Chengzhou

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:24.900
on official business last night.

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:26.340
Why so suddenly?

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:27.340
I'm not quite clear

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:28.480
on the official matters.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:30.280
Thank you.

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:36.380
(Capital Prefecture)

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:56.260
Who is it?

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:57.900
Who climbed into my bed?

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:00.460
Me.

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:01.460
Your dad.

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:02.540
Dad.

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:05.300
Oh, Dad.

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.500
Are you alright?

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:08.500
Come on.

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:09.360
Here.

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:10.980
I just fell asleep,

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:12.260
and you kicked me out of bed.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:13.660
You almost killed me.

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:14.820
How could I know it was you?

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:16.980
I thought someone was trying
to take advantage of me.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:19.340
Why did you climb into my bed?

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.260
It was late last night,

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.300
so I didn't go to the diner

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.660
and decided to tough it out here.

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:26.740
Forget it.

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.020
My mom didn't let you in, right?

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:28.860
Go away.

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:30.660
Mind your own business.

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:31.660
Sure.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:32.500
Twenty.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:36.740
Who's here so early?

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:37.580
I'll check.

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:38.700
You wait here.

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:40.180
Coming.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:44.540
Who is it?

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:46.460
What's that called?

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.240
- Eunuch.
- Eunuch.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:52.020
Aren't you serving Prince Zhao?

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:53.580
Why are you here?

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:55.220
Indeed, why are you here?

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:56.380
The Prince is busy

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:57.500
and set off last night.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:58.860
He ordered me to wait for you two.

00:07:58.890 --> 00:07:59.730
The Prince said

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:01.480
you should be cautious about moving.

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:03.100
The ladies can stay for now.

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:04.500
How about you two go

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:05.900
to Sushui City first?

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:07.680
I...

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:09.260
Eunuch,

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:10.580
you see.

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:11.740
This is sudden.

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:13.980
- We're not prepared yet.
- Yes.

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:15.780
Our family hasn't decided it.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:16.620
Why not

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:17.700
wait for a while?

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:18.940
Yes.

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:20.340
So, you haven't decided.

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:22.700
It's not about being unprepared.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.700
You two just don't want to go.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.060
Forget it.

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:28.060
The Prince never likes to force anyone.

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:30.340
I'll go and report back.

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:32.420
No, it's not that.

00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:33.180
Say something!

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:34.140
We can't let Prince Zhao

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:35.140
think we're ungrateful.

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:35.980
Why not...?

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:38.420
Eunuch.

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:40.660
Please wait.

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:47.460
(Start Near to Go Far)

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:49.700
Put some effort into it.

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:51.100
I'm putting in all the effort.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:52.420
I'm trying, okay?

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:55.460
What are you two doing?

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:56.940
Well.

00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:57.860
Let's go.

00:08:58.380 --> 00:08:59.420
Dad, you...

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:02.260
Mom, Prince Zhao wants us
to go to Sushui City.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:04.960
Dad thinks that if all of us go
and don't want to stay there,

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:06.700
it'll be troublesome.

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:08.460
So, we'll go first.

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:10.180
Alright, let's go.

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:11.340
We'll go first.

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:20.220
Always making trouble.

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:22.500
(Yunshui Manor)

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:23.700
Slow down.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:24.600
Be careful.

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:25.460
- Here.
- Careful.

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:27.500
Wait, wait.

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:30.460
- You're so impulsive.
- Put them on.

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:32.100
We should at least discuss this

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:33.060
with Jicai and Mr. Lin.

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:34.900
What's there to discuss?

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.340
It's a great opportunity.

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:38.180
Besides, they're leaving soon.

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:39.620
There's no time to discuss.

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:41.180
Why leave in such a hurry?

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:42.620
No one is going with you.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:43.710
What if

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.100
you cause trouble there?

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:46.580
What trouble could there be?

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:47.780
Even if there is trouble,

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:49.620
can't I handle it?

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:51.340
Sorry.

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:53.220
I must report asap

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:54.940
whether you'll go.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:56.260
It's getting late.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:57.620
I can't afford to delay.

00:09:57.980 --> 00:09:59.260
It's getting late.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:00.180
Let's go.

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:03.540
Shen Jianshe.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.060
You want to go, right?

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:06.420
Then go by yourself.

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:07.420
You stay.

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:09.100
Don't, Mom...

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:10.340
Dad...

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:12.540
Mom,

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:14.000
you can't let Dad go alone.

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:15.140
What if something happens?

00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:16.540
Besides,

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:18.580
I really want to go.

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:20.180
Look at how hospitable

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.340
they are.

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.860
Look at the carriage they prepared.

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:23.780
In the future,

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:25.460
this will be like a Bentley.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:26.580
Think about it.

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:27.900
Prince Zhao invited us,

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:29.140
sent a Bentley to pick us up,

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:30.220
and covered the expenses.

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:31.500
If we don't go,

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:33.980
wouldn't that be disrespectful
to Bentley?

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:36.380
Let's go. He starts with a Bentley.

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:37.820
There must be something better.

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:38.680
Let's go.

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:39.560
Wait.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.300
What about Yangyang?

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.500
We can't leave Jicai to look after her.

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:45.900
Running the diner is tiring enough.

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:48.180
Indeed.

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:53.180
I took our parents and Yangyang

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:54.460
to Sushui City for a look.

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:56.340
Once it's settled,
I'll come back for you.

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:58.020
They all left?

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:00.140
Why didn't you stop them?

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:01.780
(Yunshui Manor)
They're your family.

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:04.140
How could we stop them?

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.180
Sorry, I was too hasty.

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:08.540
Where are you going?

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:09.560
Take care of the diner.

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:10.640
I'll bring them back soon.

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:12.300
Alright, go ahead.

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:13.180
I'll take care of it.

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:20.340
Your Highness,

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:22.380
the Shen family has set off.

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:24.420
By now, Lin Yan

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:27.020
should have arrived in Chengzhou.

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:31.300
(Chengzhou Yamen)
So,

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:33.380
it was actually 32 oxen

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:34.660
that died?

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:37.140
These were not ordinary oxen.

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:39.070
They were the plowing oxen revered here.

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:41.660
Oxen are highly respected now.

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:42.900
Slaughtering oxen is considered

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:44.620
one of the ten great evils.

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:46.860
Oxen are our reliance.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:48.820
With the death of 32 oxen,

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:51.660
several families will be
in dire straits.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:53.740
(Chengzhou Yamen)
This is huge.

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:55.500
I can't handle this.

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:58.500
What should we do about this?

00:11:58.620 --> 00:11:59.470
Mr. Lin,

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:02.140
this is about the death of 32 oxen.

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:05.140
The culprit must be caught.

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:07.940
First, investigate
the water sources and feed,

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:10.100
and you'll know
if someone has poisoned them.

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:11.800
But with 32 oxen dying suddenly,

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.100
it's likely a livestock disease.

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:14.180
Take preventive measures

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:16.380
and consult experienced farmers.

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:17.460
Finally,

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:19.590
conduct a ritual for the oxen.

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:22.580
I see.

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:25.460
No wonder, despite your youth,

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.140
you've risen so swiftly in the Capital.

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:28.020
You're truly wise,

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:29.740
thinking so thoroughly.

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:31.820
What's so hard about it?

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:32.660
Are you

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:33.920
stupid?

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:35.220
For such a minor issue,

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:36.660
how dare you summon the Vice Prefect

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:37.940
all the way from Yong'an?

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:42.230
Perhaps someone

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:43.090
has tipped you off,

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:45.220
saying that in such cases,

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.270
you can seek help from the Capital?

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:49.310
Yes, yes.

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:51.050
How did you know?

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:52.940
A few days ago,

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:54.420
I didn't know what to do.

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:56.420
Someone wrote to me,

00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:58.420
advising me to seek you out.

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.430
They said you're very kind

00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:03.180
and can be approached for any matter.

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:04.140
Who was it?

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.620
Did they leave a name?

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:08.180
No.

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:20.260
What's going on?

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:22.710
Auntie.

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:23.710
Jicai.

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:25.780
Please wait for me.

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:27.820
Why are you here?

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:30.020
- Attendant Xu.
- Lady Shen.

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:31.940
Are you also going to Sushui City?

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.140
Please get in the carriage.

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:35.450
That doesn't matter.

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:37.100
Let me speak with my family first.

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:38.380
Lady Shen, please.

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:39.220
Jicai.

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:40.780
Get down.

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:42.100
Get on.

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:43.900
Mom, let me talk to her.

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:45.180
Jicai, get on.

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:46.620
In broad daylight,

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:47.560
what are you afraid of?

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:49.260
Get on, come on.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:50.860
Get on.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:13:59.240
You're really bold,

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:00.420
leaving with them like this.

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:01.900
Aren't you worried about your kidneys?

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:04.420
You're overthinking.

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:06.300
The ancients wouldn't know

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:07.500
about such a profitable scheme.

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:08.500
- You...
- Everyone.

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:09.580
If we delay the journey,

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:11.500
the Prince will blame me.

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:13.580
Come out now.

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:14.940
Why?

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:16.980
We'll just take a look.

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:18.300
What could happen?

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:20.140
Besides, we've come halfway.

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:21.580
It'd be embarrassing to go back now.

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:23.060
We're not getting out.

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:24.500
Come on.

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:25.820
I've told them,

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:26.760
but they won't listen.

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:29.460
- What are you doing?
- Let's go.

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:30.740
- Be careful.
- I won't.

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:31.860
Gongcai, help me.

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:33.340
- No, it's dangerous.
- Let's go.

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:34.500
Attendant Xu, let's go.

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:35.540
- Hurry up.
- Dad.

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:36.740
Dad.

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:38.540
- Jicai.
- Jicai.

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:39.760
- Are you okay?
- I told you

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:40.980
- to be careful.
- Slow down.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.620
- Are you okay?
- Auntie, are you okay?

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:43.470
- How nice.
- Auntie.

00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:44.720
Let's go together.

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:46.700
- It'll be fine.
- Hurry up.

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:48.020
This...

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:56.820
(Sushui City)

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.140
This place is huge.

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:21.300
Do you think they cleared it out

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:22.980
just to welcome us?

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:24.380
It's possible.

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:26.140
There's no one around; it's so grand.

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.980
(Sushui City)

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:35.970
- What's wrong?
- Right.

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:37.460
Why is the gate closed?

00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:45.830
I...

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:46.980
This...

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:55.180
Help!

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:57.020
Anyone there?

00:15:58.220 --> 00:15:59.740
Do you know who I am?

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:01.340
I'm the best brother

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:02.580
of Prince Zhao.

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:04.740
Alright, stop shouting.

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:06.460
Can't you see?

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:08.000
It's your so-called good brother

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.400
who wants your kidneys.

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:11.620
How could such a good thing be true?

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:12.460
A prince

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:14.300
offers to fund your diner?

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:15.660
Have you

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:17.100
lost your mind?

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:20.180
Dad.

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:22.140
And you, Shen Gongcai.

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:23.180
You're an adult now.

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:25.140
Have you thought about your kid?

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:27.420
Yangyang.

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:29.340
I'm wrong.

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:31.020
Sorry.

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:32.980
Since you've made a mistake,

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:34.820
what should you do now

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:36.620
according to our family rules?

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:40.140
Admit the mistake.

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:42.740
Reflect deeply.

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:43.940
So, who do you think

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:46.140
is most responsible this time?

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:49.780
- Well.
- This time...

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:50.740
About this...

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:56.460
Dad, this is not the time
for your usual routine.

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:57.500
Mom, did you see that?

00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:59.380
Dad was trying to bribe me,
but I caught him.

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:00.320
- Shen Jianshe.
- Mom.

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:01.980
I've criticized him severely.

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:02.940
Anyway,

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:04.380
this time,

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:05.380
it really is your fault.

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:07.060
What do you mean?

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:08.000
Come on.

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:09.300
Am I still your father?

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:10.300
Stop denying it.

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:11.340
It's partly my fault,

00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:13.220
but Gongcai is also at fault.

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:14.060
Dad.

00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:16.260
You were also very eager

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:17.700
- to go with them.
- Exactly.

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:18.860
Look.

00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:20.660
Even Yangyang can't stand it.

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:22.180
Can't you two

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:23.340
do something useful for once?

00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:24.580
Always messing around.

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:25.580
What will you do?

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:27.020
Turn over a new leaf.

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:28.260
Start anew.

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:29.340
Can you do that?

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:30.460
Yes.

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:31.740
Alright, sit down.

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:35.980
Think about it.

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:38.420
They gave us the best along the road,

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:39.780
without raising any suspicions.

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:41.540
It was only after we entered
Sushui City

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:42.660
that Prince Zhao turned on us

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:44.180
and imprisoned us here.

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:46.420
So, I might be right before.

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:48.980
The relationship between Prince Zhao
and Lin Yan is not simple.

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:50.500
Prince Zhao

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:52.380
wants to use us as hostages.

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:54.020
Hostages?

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:54.940
No way.

00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:59.140
I have an idea.

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:00.940
If someone wants to use us,

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:03.860
the simplest way is

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:06.540
to make ourselves useless.

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:09.540
Who'd want to use good-for-nothings?

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:11.540
So, why don't we just confess

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:12.860
that Jicai was not the lady

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:14.980
who was engaged to the ancestor?

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:16.860
At most, we're freeloaders,

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:19.300
and Mr. Lin is an unlucky landlord.

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:20.780
We're not close at all.

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:22.460
How can Prince Zhao use us then?

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:23.380
Forget it.

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:24.900
Would Prince Zhao believe that?

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:26.020
We've lived with the ancestor

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:27.780
for so long.

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.420
This reflection is working.

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:31.580
Your mind is working

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:32.860
better than your son's.

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:34.620
- I'll continue.
- Shut up.

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:37.300
Mr. Lin has been so kind to us.

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:38.640
You can't distance yourself

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:39.980
when trouble comes.

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:41.420
- No.
- You can't do this.

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:42.380
Exactly.

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:44.740
I'll keep reflecting.

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:46.620
Yes, Mr. Lin is family.

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:48.060
Grandpa and Grandma said

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.620
that family members should bear
everything together.

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:52.860
See? Yangyang is so sensible.

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:56.180
Before I came to find you,

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:58.220
I went to the Prefecture first.

00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:00.980
They said that Mr. Lin had happened
to leave for work.

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:02.980
Isn't that too coincidental?

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:04.340
It's not normal.

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:23.380
Someone's coming.

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:37.620
Who are they?

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:04.620
Why does this scene

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:05.900
look familiar?

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:07.220
Mr. Lin

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:08.420
was just scaring us.

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:09.860
But these people

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:11.420
look like they're serious.

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:14.860
My goodness.

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:16.540
It's alright.

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:17.660
It's fine.

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:20.060
Judging by your clothes and appearance,

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:21.620
you must be the young prince.

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:23.300
The young prince?

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:25.620
Sir, you have us now.

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:27.300
We can be useful to you.

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:29.220
But if you harm us now,

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:30.900
the benefits will be too small.

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:45.580
You're clever.

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:47.660
I won't beat around the bush.

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:49.700
I have some questions,

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:51.300
but asking directly

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:53.140
is too boring.

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:13.540
How about

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:15.500
we play a game?

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:17.500
I'll spin this spoon.

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:19.820
Whoever the handle points to

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:21.460
will answer the question.

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:22.780
If you answer well,

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:25.500
you can choose a torture device.

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:26.780
If not,

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:30.780
you'll drink this poisoned soup.

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:32.580
How about that?

00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:34.220
Isn't it fun?

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:35.820
- Not fun at all.
- Dad.

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:37.420
- Are you giving us a choice?
- Exactly.

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:39.180
You're making us choose how to die.

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:40.860
That's not fair at all.

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:46.540
I'll play with you.

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:48.100
- Jicai.
- No way.

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:49.340
- Absolutely not.
- Auntie.

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:50.220
You can't.

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:52.620
We have to follow the game rules.

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:22.340
Dad.

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:24.060
You're cheating.

00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:25.420
Dad.

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:30.860
It's you.

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:32.340
No.

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:33.180
No way.

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:35.260
She's just a child; what does she know?

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:46.540
Shaojie.

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:52.740
I'll play with you.

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:03.720
- Dad.
- Tell me.

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:04.620
Gongcai.

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:06.660
Tell me everything you know.

00:23:06.810 --> 00:23:07.780
What do you want to know?

00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:09.020
Ask away.

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:10.100
Why do you always

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:11.340
beat around the bush?

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:13.460
How could I know what you want to know?

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:14.390
How could you not know

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:15.660
what I want to know?

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:16.700
I want to know

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:19.300
your secrets.

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:23.300
Yes.

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:24.140
I have secrets.

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:25.540
Let me think.

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:27.580
My wife later found a better man.

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:28.430
I didn't stop her.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.360
I even encouraged her
to embrace a better life.

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:31.900
When she moved into that big villa,

00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:33.260
- What?
- I even drove her there.

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:34.260
You brat.

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:36.020
How could you say that?

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:38.220
You've disgraced our family name.

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:39.180
Grandpa.

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:40.810
Grandpa.

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:42.300
Calm down.

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:43.420
How can I stay calm?

00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:46.620
What were you thinking?

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:48.900
Your wife ran off with someone.

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:51.100
Instead of killing
that adulterous couple,

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:52.220
you said something like that?

00:23:52.290 --> 00:23:53.440
Are you even a man?

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:55.020
Are you a man at all?

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:56.780
I completely agree with you.

00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:58.300
Why are you so agitated?

00:23:58.360 --> 00:23:58.740
Besides,

00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:00.120
just because my wife cheated on me,

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:01.340
does that mean I'm not a man

00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:02.500
if I don't shout for revenge?

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:03.380
The key is,

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:04.780
I really am a loser.

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:06.340
She found something better.

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:07.380
What's wrong with that?

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:08.540
Isn't that just human nature?

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:10.420
What nonsense.

00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:12.180
Isn't that nonsense?

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:15.470
- I...
- We have work to do.

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:17.180
What do I have?

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:18.380
I...

00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:21.580
Stop playing tricks.

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:22.900
Just confess.

00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:25.820
- Don't.
- Grandpa.

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:28.420
Weren't we having a good chat just now?

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:32.540
Come out.

00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:33.820
- Come out.
- Let her go.

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:34.860
What are you doing?

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:35.700
Come out.

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:37.020
Yangyang.

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:39.980
Yangyang!

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:40.920
- Confess.
- Yangyang.

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:42.060
Let her go.

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:42.900
If you don't talk,

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:46.380
she'll die.

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:47.820
Don't, don't.

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:49.220
Sir, I beg you.

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:50.060
Don't hurt her.

00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:51.100
Kill me instead, sir.

00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:52.440
- Dad.
- She's just a child.

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:53.330
Sir.

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:54.180
Yangyang.

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:55.340
Kill me.

00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:56.500
Just kill me.

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:57.340
Is that okay?

00:24:58.260 --> 00:24:59.100
Shen.

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:07.380
I know about Lin Yan.

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:09.700
Jicai.

00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:15.620
He cares about me,

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:16.780
but official matters

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:18.580
can't be discussed with him.

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:20.500
(Not official matters.)

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:22.140
(So, I can tell him something personal.)

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:24.340
Tell me then.

00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:26.500
Lin Yan

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:27.980
is actually Cui Che.

00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:30.500
His clan committed grave crimes

00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:31.740
and was exterminated.

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:34.140
Lin Yan changed his name
and household registration

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:35.300
to survive.

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:36.700
You harbored a wanted criminal.

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:39.260
Why tell me that?

00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:40.940
You're so calm after hearing this.

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:43.180
It seems you know more about that.

00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:45.380
I'll tell you something you don't know.

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:46.540
Lin Yan

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:48.100
broke off the engagement

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:49.300
to get close to the Princess.

00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:50.660
He wanted the Princess

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:51.880
to help him hide his identity.

00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:09.060
- Yangyang.
- Lin Yan abandoned us.

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:11.100
Why should we be loyal to him?

00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:12.300
Sir,

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:14.860
we are on your side.

00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:16.380
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:17.530
We are on your side.

00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:18.500
We are on the same side.

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:20.100
Indeed, I feel the same way.

00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:22.580
Did you notice

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:25.580
something wrong with Lin Yan?

00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:27.500
Everything's wrong with him.

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:29.780
As the son of an executed prisoner,

00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:32.260
he became the Vice Prefect.

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:33.820
How could that be right?

00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:34.940
Sir,

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:36.340
let us go.

00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:37.740
We'll help you investigate him.

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:39.430
We'll assist you.

00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:40.580
We'll investigate together.

00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:41.860
I thought the same thing.

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:43.500
I just couldn't find
the words to say it.

00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:50.540
(Complete and Bright)

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:05.460
Lin Yan wanted to get close
to the Princess

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:06.960
and broke off the engagement.

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:08.820
The Shen family claims

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:10.500
they want to take revenge on him.

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:13.940
You asked me
to find out more about them,

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:15.060
so I did.

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:17.100
The Qingyang dialect
is hard to understand,

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:19.100
but I managed to get the gist of it.

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:23.300
Cui Che's fiancée is indeed a Shen,

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:25.820
but they moved away
from Qingyang long ago.

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:27.300
After the Cui family's downfall,

00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:28.820
they cut off all contact.

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:30.900
They did abandon them.

00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:33.340
With the betrothal being canceled,

00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:35.140
they harbor resentment.

00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:40.900
I've dealt with the Shen family.

00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:43.060
In fact,

00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:45.260
they do have feelings

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:47.820
for Anran.

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:49.500
It's not just about climbing up.

00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:52.620
As for Anran and the Princess,

00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:54.180
that's even less believable.

00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:56.860
How about this?

00:27:58.100 --> 00:27:59.260
Let's starve them for now,

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:00.620
and then

00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:03.060
I will question them myself.

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:07.300
You care about Lin Yan,

00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:09.660
so I can't torture them,

00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:11.220
yet you're dissatisfied with my results.

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:12.460
What exactly do you want?

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:15.660
Lin Yan is not on our side.

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:17.090
After over a decade,

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:18.980
are you going soft for him?

00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:21.860
Sometimes, I don't even understand

00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:23.300
which one of us is your son,

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:25.500
me or Lin Yan.

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:29.740
How dare you!

00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:30.740
Let me tell you.

00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:32.380
If you had Anran's abilities,

00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:33.940
I'd look up to you, too.

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:36.540
Let me analyze this for you.

00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:38.500
Even without the betrothal,

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:40.080
Anran still kept them

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:41.240
in his house.

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:42.120
Why?

00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:43.980
This means

00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:45.820
they're Anran's weakness.

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:49.140
Can't you see that?

00:28:57.580 --> 00:28:59.540
Lin Yan sensed something amiss

00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:00.800
and set off back to the Capital.

00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:04.420
(Capital Prefecture)

00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:11.900
- Mr. Lin.
- What's wrong?

00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:13.500
While you were away,

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:14.740
Lady Shen has come for you.

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:15.840
I heard about it

00:29:15.850 --> 00:29:16.900
and went to Yunshui Manor.

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:18.940
Then I heard from the guards

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:20.500
that the Shen family had left

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:21.860
following the same carriage.

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:23.100
I was told

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:24.900
they went to Sushui City.

00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:26.700
Was the Governor of Chengzhou

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:27.740
truly misled?

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:29.100
- They wanted...
- Mr. Lin.

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:30.060
Young Master.

00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:35.100
Slow down, Mr. Lin.

00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:36.500
Mr. Lin.

00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:37.460
Slow down, Mr. Lin.

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:40.180
(Capital Prefecture)
Where is he going?

00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:42.780
His Majesty heard Mr. Lin was back

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:44.980
and sent me to bring him to the Palace.

00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:45.940
This...

00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:48.260
Thank you for the trouble..

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:51.060
Before Mr. Lin went to Chengzhou,

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:53.360
he suffered from heart disease.

00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:55.240
When he was in Chengzhou,

00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:56.360
he worked without rest,

00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:57.340
never closing his eyes.

00:29:57.340 --> 00:29:59.460
He rushed back to the Capital nonstop,

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:01.020
so he couldn't see the Emperor now.

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:02.140
Heart disease?

00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:08.620
Didn't he just ride off on horseback?

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:09.460
He...

00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:10.500
Well.

00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:12.980
He's in a hurry to see a physician.

00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:14.340
That's faster.

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:35.940
This mutton soup is so good.

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:37.340
Yes, delicious.

00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:40.940
This pastry is nice too. Try some.

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:42.640
- Sure.
- Here.

00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:44.010
Eat the big marrow bones.

00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:45.300
Hurry up.

00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:48.100
I'm hungry, too.

00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:50.500
Eat up, there's plenty.

00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:51.660
Smells good, right?

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:54.780
Is it good?

00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:56.980
I can't stand it.

00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:01.380
What are you doing?

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:02.820
It's been two days.

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:03.700
We've had no food

00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:04.500
or water.

00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:05.740
Trying to starve us to death?

00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:06.800
Do you have any humanity?

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:08.520
Can't you see there's a child here?

00:31:13.890 --> 00:31:15.820
Even when hungry,
you can still shout so loudly.

00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:16.760
If you bark like a dog,

00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:18.180
I'll reward you.

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:19.220
How about that?

00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:22.660
I'll fight you.

00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:23.660
Gongcai.

00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:24.540
Dad.

00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:25.420
Find the keys.

00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:26.260
Hurry, hurry.

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:27.500
What keys?

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:28.820
Who'd carry keys on them?

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:30.060
You lot, hurry up.

00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:30.900
Search lower down.

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:31.740
Hurry.

00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:33.380
Let go, let go.

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:34.220
Let go.

00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:36.620
I'll kill you.

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:41.580
We were ordered not to harm them.

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:43.660
Alright, let's leave.

00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:44.500
Let's go.

00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:45.860
Behave yourselves.

00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:47.000
You'll be starved to death.

00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:48.380
Enough.

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:51.040
- Let's go.
- Bad luck.

00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:52.700
Let's go.

00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:56.680
Go.

00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:57.980
Everything in dramas is fake.

00:31:58.020 --> 00:31:59.980
Which jailer would hide
the keys on their waist,

00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:01.160
waiting for them to be stolen?

00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:24.340
Why is there moss here?

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:26.890
Moss?

00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:28.780
These ancient prisons

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:30.420
are really poorly made.

00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:32.180
No waterproofing?

00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:33.860
An official prison

00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:35.620
shouldn't be so careless.

00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:38.340
It's done so casually.

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:40.980
Was it converted from a residence, Dad?

00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:48.940
(Sushui City)

00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:57.380
(Prince Zhao's Mansion)

00:32:58.460 --> 00:32:59.700
(Prince Zhao's Mansion)

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:35.060
Have you forgotten
the rules Prince Zhao set

00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:37.020
when he taught us swordsmanship?

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:38.580
Everyone is equal.

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:40.380
Only the capable deserve respect.

00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:42.580
I defeated you all.

00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:44.340
You shouldn't even stand before me.

00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:46.740
Are you going to fight me now?

00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:03.620
You misled Chengzhou

00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:05.220
into summoning me.

00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:07.020
Where is the Shen family now?

00:34:10.410 --> 00:34:11.260
Anran,

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:13.740
listen to me.

00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:16.300
Your engagement has been canceled.

00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:17.900
If they continue to live with you,

00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:19.180
what should you do

00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:20.500
if someone finds out?

00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:21.540
Leave

00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:23.220
this matter to me.

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:25.180
I will deal with it properly.

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:27.820
Where is the Shen family now?

00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:35.980
Why are you so stubborn?

00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:37.580
Everything I've done

00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:38.820
is for your good.

00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:43.100
Your Highness,

00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:45.060
please let them go.

00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:56.060
Stop.

00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:00.180
Anran,

00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:02.820
since you've made up your mind,

00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:05.420
I won't stop you.

00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:08.060
You,

00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:10.500
take him there.

00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:12.380
Yes.

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:23.860
You're indulging Lin Yan again.

00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:26.100
Didn't you say the Shens
would be useful?

00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:28.300
And now Lin Yan is taking them away.

00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:29.420
Why are you

00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:32.220
still so impatient?

00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:33.980
Do you

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:36.860
have other plans?

00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:40.220
Don't worry.

00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:43.540
That man

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:45.420
will buy us some time.

00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:46.940
Go now

00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:48.860
and move the Shen family

00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:49.860
to the annex.

00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:51.340
Yes.

00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:08.660
You've never defied the Prince before.

00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:10.460
This is the first time.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.900
When you first arrived at Fuyi Manor,

00:36:13.450 --> 00:36:15.280
the Prince's eldest son
had just passed away.

00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:17.560
Your demeanor and speech
were strikingly similar to his,

00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:20.100
which comforted the Prince's grief
over losing a child.

00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:21.660
What are you trying to say?

00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:23.660
I'm just thinking

00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:25.860
maybe we've misjudged you.

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:27.980
Perhaps, despite your young age,

00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:29.270
you have a strong will.

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:31.550
You planned to imitate the young master

00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:33.480
to get close to the Prince.

00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:36.300
Don't think

00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:38.790
that you can delay me

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:40.180
by bringing up the past.

00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:41.860
Lead the way.

00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:48.100
Why are you in such a panic?

00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:49.260
Young Master.

00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:51.300
The Shen family has escaped.

00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:52.140
What?

00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:17.100
Listen.

00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:19.340
Look at this window.

00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:21.300
It's very poorly made.

00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:22.700
And these bars

00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:24.080
are mortise-and-tenon joints.

00:37:24.210 --> 00:37:25.140
If I can find

00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:26.620
the key joint,

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:28.060
I can open it.

00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:29.740
Really?

00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:32.180
Dad, when did you learn this?

00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:33.660
- Well.
- In the countryside,

00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:35.340
everyone knew
how to build a house before.

00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:36.420
Your dad hasn't lost

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:37.580
this good old tradition.

00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:40.380
Alright, go up there.

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:42.180
Go and check.

00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:43.020
Hurry up.

00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:46.220
Be careful. Hurry.

is that my dad can't make it.)
