I'm home. You should head back.

00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:09.866
You have to explain yourself to Mr. Lu.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.200
Aren't you going to host me?

Please come in.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.280
Don't tell anyone

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.519
you saw me crying today.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.480
What?

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:41.280
Who cried?

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.920
I didn't.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.920
I wasn't crying.

00:01:56.266 --> 00:01:58.280
We can see that lighthouse
from your place.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.799
How romantic.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.120
Don't you think the light of
a lighthouse is a sign of hope?

Your breakfast is on the table.
Remember to take it.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.240
You're heading to work?

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:53.720
Yes.

00:04:54.711 --> 00:04:56.270
Wait for me. We're leaving together.

00:04:58.133 --> 00:04:59.240
What if we're spotted

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.800
going into the office together?

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.920
I'll give you half a day off.

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:05.040
Did you forget something?

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:24.839
I never said
you could take advantage of me.

Put on a band-aid

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:52.759
just in case.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Is this what you tried

00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:01.480
to remind me of?

00:06:02.933 --> 00:06:04.133
What else could it be?

00:06:04.519 --> 00:06:05.639
What were you thinking?

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.879
I'm off to work.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.920
You didn't see what happened yesterday.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.759
Ms. Gu smashed someone's head.

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:22.360
I never expected a career woman like her

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.466
would smash someone's head.

00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:24.920
Yeah, how impressive of her.

00:06:24.955 --> 00:06:26.688
She just hit it
with that wine bottle. Gosh.

00:06:26.688 --> 00:06:28.040
She even had a backup plan.

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:30.279
It's that marketing account contract.

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:30.959
How insane.

00:06:30.959 --> 00:06:32.319
That was simply cool.

00:06:32.519 --> 00:06:34.399
What are you all talking about?

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:36.759
We heard you were really cool yesterday.

00:06:37.079 --> 00:06:38.199
Don't imitate that.

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:39.120
No fighting.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.360
If you win, you go to jail.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.439
If you lose, you end up
in the hospital. Got it?

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:45.360
- Okay.
- Yeah, but you look great today.

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:51.639
Gu Liusu.

00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:54.160
Explain yourself. If you come clean,
I'll be lenient with you.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.622
Otherwise,
you'll receive a punishment.

00:06:59.399 --> 00:07:00.879
Why are you here, bestie?

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:02.360
Why do you think I'm here?

00:07:02.959 --> 00:07:04.120
Get back to work.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.199
What's wrong, bestie?

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:11.920
Tell me.

00:07:12.759 --> 00:07:14.759
What is it?

00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:15.600
That man.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:16.839
Who are you talking about?

00:07:16.839 --> 00:07:17.800
Don't play dumb with me.

00:07:17.959 --> 00:07:19.079
When did it start?

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:20.720
Yesterday.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:21.920
Yesterday?

00:07:22.279 --> 00:07:24.000
I swear it was really yesterday.

00:07:24.199 --> 00:07:25.720
You started flirting yesterday?

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:29.560
That would be

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.560
Lu Xingchen.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:33.360
Oh my god!

00:07:35.439 --> 00:07:37.360
My head... My head's spinning,

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.319
darling!

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.560
You... You actually kept this
from me all this time!

00:07:42.111 --> 00:07:43.600
You owe me a reasonable explanation.

00:07:43.839 --> 00:07:45.480
No, listen to my excuse.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.000
Hear me out.

00:07:48.439 --> 00:07:49.639
Because things were too messy

00:07:49.639 --> 00:07:51.639
at the beginning.

00:07:51.639 --> 00:07:53.720
I was afraid we'd get awkward.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.240
When I realized
it was a misunderstanding,

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.999
I decided to just keep it from you
because I didn't want it to get awkward.

00:07:57.999 --> 00:07:58.560
So I just...

00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:59.120
Stop!

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.199
You're not aware of
how serious this problem is.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.319
You once told me

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.439
there are no secrets between us.

00:08:08.759 --> 00:08:10.759
And now you kept that from me

00:08:11.519 --> 00:08:12.839
because of a man?

00:08:12.839 --> 00:08:14.160
Are you mad because of that?

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.399
Of course.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.279
But he's your husband's biological son.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.439
So what?

00:08:21.639 --> 00:08:22.720
You're really not mad?

00:08:24.959 --> 00:08:27.000
That's great!

00:08:28.079 --> 00:08:30.279
I thought you were mad
because of Lu Xingchen.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.720
Do you know
how grave a mistake you made?

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.759
I do.

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:37.759
What now, my lady?

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:39.720
If you two end up together,

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:42.799
then we can always stick together.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.399
And there won't be any in-law drama.

00:08:45.399 --> 00:08:46.399
Am I right?

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.600
End up together?
What do you mean by that?

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.080
Haven't you made it official yet?

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.000
He hasn't asked me to do so.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.000
I never thought
the Lu family's youngest son

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.799
would allow you to use him.

00:09:02.559 --> 00:09:04.720
Mrs. Lu, I'm at work.
Don't get in my way.

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.240
You should leave first. Did you know?

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.644
People would gossip about me tomorrow

00:09:07.666 --> 00:09:09.030
due to your presence here.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.559
Then, when will he become your husband?

00:09:11.559 --> 00:09:14.360
None of your business. Go now.

00:09:17.133 --> 00:09:19.030
(I never thought
the Lu family's youngest son)

00:09:19.039 --> 00:09:21.840

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:25.879

(But should he be the one
to make it official?)

00:09:38.559 --> 00:09:39.360
Hi.

00:09:41.279 --> 00:09:43.480
(Should I ask him instead?)

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.360
Does it still hurt?

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:52.960
What was on your mind?

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.488
You were so deep in thought.
