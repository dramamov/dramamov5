WEBVTT

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.920
Hey!

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.320
What exactly did you give Mr. Chen to drink

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.050
that's causing him such agony?

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.840
If you've done anything suspicious

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.500
and Mr. Chen comes to any harm,

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.660
I'll have your head separated from your body right now.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.000
Where is Nongyu?

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.360
Master.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.800
I'm here.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:01.330
Mr. Chen.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.360
Nongyu.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.769
You truly have remarkable skills.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.010
How are you feeling now?

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.039
Don't you feel in your mouth,

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:10.720
first bitter then astringent,

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.640
finally changing from a musky sandalwood aroma to a sweet aftertaste,

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.760
instantly refreshing your mind and spirit,

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.820
as if your head has suddenly cleared?

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.240
Yes, exactly.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.880
My headache is actually gone.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.680
Nongyu,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.360
what magical medicine did you use?

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.130
It's not really any magical medicine.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.680
It's just that...

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:35.520
the catalyst is somewhat special.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.920
Medicinal catalyst.

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:42.160
Nongyu.

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:43.120
Come.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.650
Sit down.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.880
I'm not showing off.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.360
I just tasted hundreds of herbs in the Western Regions years ago.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.440
Over time, they've entered my body.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.440
Some of them are precious herbs.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.770
Rare in Central Plains.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.160
Just now I used my blood as a catalyst.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.660
And it finally worked.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.400
Using blood as a catalyst.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.840
So you've turned yourself

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.160
into medicine for me.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.840
Making this bitter medicine

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.520
into sweet nectar.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.060
I wondered why this medicine was so miraculous.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.640
So this is the secret.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.040
Master.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.240
Indeed, fortune comes from the west.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.840
Now with this excellent medicine,

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.770
it's truly a blessing from heaven.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.680
I am deeply grateful for your kindness, Mr. Chen.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.520
It is my honor to help you solve your problems.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.640
It is my blessing.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.280
Nongyu.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.079
You've done well in providing the medicine.

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:50.000
I shall reward you generously.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.120
How about a chest of gold leaves?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.240
I do not seek wealth.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.930
Not seeking wealth?

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.130
Then you must be after fame.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.440
Then I shall take up my brush.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.080
How about I write you a plaque?

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.720
I do not seek fame either.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.840
Money. You don't want it.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.540
Fame. You don't want that either.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.680
What exactly do you want?

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:24.440
Guards!

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.079
Yes, sir.

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:26.360
Arrest her.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.890
Yes, sir.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.640
Lord Chen.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.900
Lord Chen, please hear me out.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.400
I lost my father when I was young.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.280
My mother died of illness three years ago.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.560
Born in these chaotic times,

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.600
all alone,

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.040
drifting like duckweed.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.940
I have no one to rely on,

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.240
living in fear every day,

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.300
barely surviving.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.480
Fortunately, heaven blessed me

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.840
to meet you, Lord Chen.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.620
I don't want anything.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.360
I only ask for your protection.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.280
Allow a weak woman like me

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.040
to have a place to stay.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.380
I beg for your mercy, Sir Chen.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:10.640
Nongyu.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.040
Don't cry.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.920
Nongyu.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.920
Come.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.360
Come.

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:21.339
Your tears have made me

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.440
feel pity for you.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.560
Aren't you just asking for shelter?

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.440
I will grant your request.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.880
Please be kind, gentlemen.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.320
Please buy us both.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.680
Sir.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:01.440
Sir.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:05.440
Madam.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.720
Come, Yezi.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.660
Let the lady have a look at you.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.720
What's your name?

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:17.480
Tell her quickly.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.560
Little Yezi.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.200
Sister.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.480
Yezi.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.640
Didn't I just tell you?

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.080
I'm taking you out to find a better life.

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.360
Look at this lady.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.480
She clearly has a kind heart.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.920
Right?

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.040
Come, bow to her.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.000
May the merciful lady be blessed with fortune and longevity.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.640
Please don't just buy me.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.680
Take both me and my sister.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.120
Please buy us both.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.860
Young lady.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.800
Do you have any other family?

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:43.290
To be honest, madam.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.800
We sisters have no one left.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.060
No relatives anymore.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.880
Chang'an is in chaos now.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.040
We're homeless with no one to rely on.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.720
We haven't eaten anything

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.920
for three days.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.520
We can do any hard work.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.320
Please give us some food, madam.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:56.360
All right.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.320
The lady will give you food.

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.080
Get up now.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.600
I have a piece of bread here. Take it for now.

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.080
Sister, I'm hungry.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:08.680
Come, Yezi.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.850
Eat quickly.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.570
Wait for me a moment.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.300
Lend me some money.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:26.720
No money.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.280
That bowl of tea leaves you despise

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.880
would be enough for a full meal for these sisters.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.880
Mr. Li, as an official of the Chen household,

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.340
surely you won't let them starve and freeze.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:38.680
Give me money.

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.770
You act like a saint while I pay?

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.409
That's not how it works.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.480
Officer Li, you've spent your life tracking and arresting people.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.040
You must have killed many, haven't you?

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.720
Why not take this opportunity

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.320
to let me help you accumulate some good karma?

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:58.320
I don't need that.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.060
What are you doing?

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.210
No touching between men and women.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.120
Fine.

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:09.540
I'll give it to you.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.840
Here, have some food.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:37.480
Little cutie.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:38.520
I've checked.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.570
The travel documents are in order.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.760
And there's nothing suspicious about the newly opened clinic.

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.360
The rest of her time is spent

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.880
buying herbs and daily necessities in the market,

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:50.040
while all other hours she's seeing patients at the clinic.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.560
What about the patients?

00:07:52.159 --> 00:07:53.440
No suspicious individuals.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.560
So you're saying

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.040
this female medical expert

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.080
is actually innocent.

00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:58.920
Good.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:07:59.800
Good.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:01.120
Here.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.640
So from now on,

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.920
we have another person to care for, don't we?

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:08.400
Sir,

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.320
this woman's identity is still unclear.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.980
We must not let our guard down.

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.680
Since her medicine is effective,

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.680
why not have her prepare it at the clinic

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:16.740
while I supervise?

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.120
Once the medicine is ready,

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.450
I'll have it delivered to your residence.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:23.090
That's fine.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.320
Very well, very well.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.290
How's the investigation on Nongyu going?

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.400
No flaws at all.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.340
She clearly came well-prepared.

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:39.370
This woman's methods are extraordinary.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.840
If she wasn't trying to kill Chen Jingbian...

00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:44.600
So that means

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.090
she's also after the Night Firefly Painting.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:50.360
Right now,

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.170
we have another formidable opponent.

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:55.970
Do whatever it takes

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.360
to find out what she's really after.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.090
But you must be careful.

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:01.920
With her cunning,

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.100
she will certainly try to use you.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.700
I'm well aware of that.

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.300
Last time she used Qi as leverage,

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.440
I was only pretending to cooperate.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.040
But no matter what,

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.440
I won't fall into her trap.

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:15.920
Remember,

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.320
those who cannot be used by me are enemies.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.850
With Qi in her custody, there's too much risk.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.530
We need to find a way to get him out quickly.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:26.290
Alright.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.020
Come, take it slow.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.200
You just recovered and now you're showing off.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:37.760
Rest.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.330
Go back and sit down.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:40.960
Sister Yu,

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.090
I feel I'm almost fully recovered.

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:44.720
Come,

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:45.400
sit down.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:51.480
I'll get you out of the city as soon as possible in the next few days.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:52.680
It's better that way.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:53.760
So I won't be a burden here.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.490
Your brother Ling would worry.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:57.520
Brother Ling,

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:58.840
they're conducting strict inspections outside lately.

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.080
It might not be easy to leave the city.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.160
I have an idea.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.300
But it involves some discomfort.

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:10.840
Let's hear it.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.560
Lie in a coffin pretending to be dead,

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.240
and be transported out during a corpse delivery.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.970
They will inspect everything.

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.280
Just throw some rotten pork in there

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.080
and claim they died from miasma.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.140
Who would be foolish enough to check?

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.220
That's a good idea.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:25.960
Worth a try.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:27.320
Look at me,

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.600
treating illnesses, saving lives,

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:30.000
and even giving you advice.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:30.760
Officer Li,

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.920
please stop making things difficult for me, will you?

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.300
When have I ever given you a hard time?

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.160
Don't think I don't know.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.240
You just don't want me to enter the Chen residence.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.600
Having the medicine prepared at the clinic before sending it over

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.000
was your idea, wasn't it?

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:50.880
Sister Yu.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.720
The medicine is about to boil over.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.120
It should be ready now.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.080
As long as I'm here,

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.540
you'll never get close to Chen Jingbian.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:08.620
Then we'll see about that.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:38.560
Yiyu

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:45.560

Assistant

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:27.240

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:27.920
