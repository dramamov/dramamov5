Stealing pancakes again?

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.690
Give me the pancake.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.630

We'd better not mess with him.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.000
He poked

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.820
one of his dad's eyes out before.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:41.910
Then his father abandoned him.

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.310
Now he lives with his grandpa.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.710
I heard

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.430
his grandpa died a few days ago.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.360
How can a dead person eat pancakes?

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.020
You said his grandpa died?

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.890
Planning to make paper clothes yourself?

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.630
Your grandpa is gone,

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.090
and your dad doesn't care?

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.079
If you give the pancake to your grandpa,

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:51.079
what will you eat?

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.380
I'll eat after Grandpa

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:54.910
finishes eating.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:03.750
Take this.

Use this money

to buy paper clothes.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.820

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.310
I'll give it to you in a few days.

Please cooperate with our investigation.

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:22.240
It's not that I won't cooperate.

How long will it be this time?

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.240
You're still hanging out with that Ni guy.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:49.800
Right?

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.600
Fine, suit yourself.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:53.500
At least you're worthy

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.360
of the Guan Yu tattoo on your back.

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:57.610
But let me tell you something.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.240
Being loyal to your Ni

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:00.430
is one thing,

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:02.190
but don't be blindly loyal.

Yeah, he doesn't even care about you.

You're still young.

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:17.260
One day when you have a family,

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.630
and if you
accidentally end up in jail again,

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:21.890
your kids might have Ni as their surname.

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:26.270
The choice is yours.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.600
You can call the police anytime.

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:32.030
You know where I live

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:32.750
anyway.

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:34.130
I can't escape.

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:36.270
Or if you're still willing

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:37.799
to treat me as your brother,

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:41.350
you can just tell me directly

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:42.909
if there's anything.

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:45.870
I'm alone here,

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:47.600
all by myself.

We didn't mean anything by it.

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:03.150
I was just curious about that scar.

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:04.790
You made it sound so serious.

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:06.600
To be honest,

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.960
we're not like the others.

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:13.750
If we had homes and business in Nanyang,

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.720
who would've come all this way

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.320
to earn this hard-won money?

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:21.480
So why did you

leave then?

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:26.390
It's all because of Tianbao.

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:31.990
Life isn't easy for all of us.

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.410
Alright, from now on...

not bring it up again, okay?

If you don't want to talk about it,

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:37.480
we won't ask.

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:47.390

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:52.750
to consider us family.

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:54.550
Ximei, what kind of talk is that?

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:56.290
Of course I'm willing.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.030
Just call me Ni Xiangdong.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.640
I've been called that for so many years.

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:07.030
I'm used to it.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:08.960
Okay.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:11.750
Ni.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.120
We're still family.

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.360
If you consider us family,

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.490
drink a little less.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:22.800

I don't know

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:03.870
when it started.

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:07.840
Unknowingly,

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:09.720
I really began to see him as Dong.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.320
All these years of guilt in my heart

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:18.980
finally found a place to rest.

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:22.710
It's like atonement.

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.300
I can't help being good to him.

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.030
Of course,

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:32.030
he's good to me too.

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:36.240
Life now

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:38.270
feels like it's turned upside down.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.950
In this world,

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.170
there's you,

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:45.150
there's Tianbao,

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:47.720
and there's Xiangdong.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.670
This Xiangdong—

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.480
he listens to me.

00:11:57.390 --> 00:11:59.590
He discusses with me about everything.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.250
Do you believe what he said?

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.640
He said he's from Yafen Village,

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:13.150
and his surname is Yu.

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.480
The place where we buried the body

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:19.080
is right in the back mountain
of Yafen Village.

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.720
He said he bought his ID card.

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:25.620
Do you believe that?

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:30.910
When he talked about the Guan Yu tattoo,

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:32.310
I felt something was off.

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:40.290
When you worked at the construction site,

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:43.030
did you ever expose what's on your back?

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:04.690
is between 20 and 25 years old.

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:05.640
Ni Xiangdong

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:06.830
was born in 1978.

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:09.200
If Wu Ximei wasn't lying,

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:10.480
Ni Xiangdong

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:12.940
really is Cao Tianbao's biological father.

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:15.720
In 2003,

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.130
Ni Xiangdong was exactly 25 years old.

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:20.240
That matches the estimated age

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.400
of the body found in Nanyang.

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:23.080
The timing of his disappearance

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:25.070
aligns with the timing

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:26.480
of the Bao Desheng

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:27.570
and Xu Qingli case.

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:28.920
Combined with all the suspicious points

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.920
about the Ni Xiangdong in Weihai...

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:39.150
I have a rather bold theory.

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:41.610
Girl.

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:44.200
My name is Ni Xiangdong.

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:45.600
My name is Ni Xiangdong.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.820
Wu Ximei has been misleading us,

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:04.050
making us believe

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:06.340
that Xu Qingli in Weihai is Ni Xiangdong.

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:08.640
In fact, the Ni Xiangdong in Weihai

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:09.940
is actually Xu Qingli.

00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:11.620
The corpse in Nanyang

00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:14.590
is Cao Tianbao's biological father.

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.370
He is the real...

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:18.310
Ni Xiangdong?

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:25.410
Xiangdong,

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:27.330
if we have a child,

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:28.310
would you want a son

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:28.960
or a daughter?

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.270
Of course a son.

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:31.550
I, Ni Xiangdong,

00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:32.880
will surely have a son.

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:34.720
If it's a son,

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:36.160
I'll take him to fish,

00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:38.720
play soccer,

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:40.160
and fight.

00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:42.070
No.

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:43.070
No fighting.

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:46.570
My son would definitely be a handful.

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.770
Forget it. I'd rather have a daughter.

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:51.810
Our daughter will be as pretty as you.

00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:58.800
No more smoking from now on.

00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:15.130
I, Ni Xiangdong, am going to be a father!

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:34.750
Get in there!

00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:46.610
Where is Ni Xiangdong?

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.220
Harm should not reach wives or children.

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:57.000
But Ni Xiangdong broke the rule first.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:57.760
My son's head

00:24:57.790 --> 00:24:58.920
took 17 stitches.

00:24:59.270 --> 00:24:59.920
Tell me,

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:00.920
what should I do

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:01.880
about this?

00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:05.060
Tell Ni Xiangdong to meet me

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:06.300
at the usual place.

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:07.810
I'll be waiting for him.

00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:59.500
You take her to Uncle Chen's place first.

00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:18.880
[Pharaoh's]

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:24.480
Where's Kan Laosan?

00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:28.770
Kan Laosan, get down here!

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:30.960
Ni.

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:33.880
Master Bao?

00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:37.400
True martial virtue
lies in ceasing strife.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:39.600
There is never an end of taking revenge.

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:42.030
Harmony brings prosperity.

00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:43.570
Come up here.

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:46.070
The three of us will talk properly.

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:50.790
In front of all these men,

00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:53.550
if we lay everything bare,

00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:55.640
you'll lose face,

00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:57.350
and so will he.

00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:58.680
Fine.

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:03.890
You guys wait here.

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:27.570
Harm should not reach wives or children.

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:28.720
You

00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:31.200
hacked Mr. Kan's son.

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:33.070
You broke the rule first.

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:34.550
Kan,

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:37.590
what you did

00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:38.930
was also a bit too much.

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:40.110
You two,

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:41.850
stop fighting,

00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:42.640
alright?

00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:43.820
Shake hands.

00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:49.440
Dong!

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:51.110
Dong!

00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:53.200
Dong!

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:03.000
Alright, enough!

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:07.590
Young man,

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:09.220
you're hot-tempered.

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:10.980
I told you not to use violence,

00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:12.510
but you insisted!

00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:19.000
Courtesy before violence.

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:20.510
I've

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.550
shown you courtesy.

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:34.790
Kan Laosan,

00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:36.880
you took my child from me!

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:39.100
I'll kill you sooner or later.

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:41.770
That is over-the-top.

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:43.700
If you don't have what it takes,

00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:46.350
don't pretend to be a boss.

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:48.590
Your wife is unlucky,

00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:51.350
stuck with a coward like you.

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:53.240
Beat him!

How did you get beaten up like this?

00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:30.090
Stop the bleeding.

00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:35.590
Xiangdong.

00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:38.590
Do you know

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:40.200
why the guys you brought

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:41.790
abandoned you

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.590
and ran away?

00:30:45.270 --> 00:30:46.750
They're all useless.

00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:49.880
It's not about being useless.

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:55.400
They came with you for so little pay.

00:30:56.790 --> 00:30:58.120
If things got physical,

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:00.400
best case, they'd end up in jail.

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.440
Worst case, they'd be in the hospital.

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:03.680
It's not worth it.

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:05.400
In this business,

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:06.680
what do we rely on?

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:08.960
Connections.

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:15.240
Kan Laosan

00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:17.510
knows how to play the game
better than you.

00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:21.110
He's got connections with the Bao family
in the north of the city.

You've got the Liang family!

Otherwise, if I take a car,

00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:32.370
I want to go to Fucheng Garden.

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:34.460
Why did you bring me to the old bridge?

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:35.740
Don't you know the way?

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:36.680
Sir,

00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:37.590
today's your wedding day.

00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:39.070
Don't get so angry.

00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:41.070
You must've received

00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:43.600
a lot of money from the guests
at your wedding.

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:47.320
Help!

00:37:47.590 --> 00:37:48.440
Help me!

00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:50.630
Help!

00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:01.190
You want money?

00:38:01.450 --> 00:38:02.660
I'll give you all my money!

00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:03.820
Please let me go!

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:05.070
Weren't you just teaching someone

00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:06.070
where to stab?

00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:07.570
Teach me too.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.190
Lots of guts here, right?

00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:10.120
Please let me go!

00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:11.150
Help!

00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:14.020
Save me!

00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:29.150
Think you're special because you're rich?

00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:30.350
You're such a coward!

00:39:58.960 --> 00:39:59.510
Dong.

00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:03.560
Lock the door.

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:06.500
Xiangdong.

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:08.140
Xiangdong!

00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:09.590
Where did you go?

00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:10.870
Xiangdong!

00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:12.670
You're scaring me.

00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:14.480
Ni Xiangdong.

00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:18.880
Are you okay?

00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:22.670
Where exactly did you go?

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:24.110
Xiangdong.

00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:26.750
Xiangdong!

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:32.660
Xiangdong.

00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:37.880
Dong.

00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:42.110
I'm so cold.

00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:44.690
Get me a blanket.

00:40:54.190 --> 00:40:55.510
Where did you go?

00:40:55.590 --> 00:40:56.520
Why are you cold?

00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:33.760
[Zeng's]

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:33.800
[Roast duck, pig ears]

00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:34.280
What do you need?

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:35.110
This, this,

00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:36.190
and that chicken.

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:36.710
Okay.

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:39.320
It's for 3 people.

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:40.170
Okay.

00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:52.000
Come with me.

00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:56.630
In broad daylight,

00:41:57.150 --> 00:41:58.480
I won't hurt you.

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:01.160
I just want to ask you something.

00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:02.720
Get in the car.

00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:09.880
I'll come back for it later.

00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:10.360
Okay.
