00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.360
Hello, my name is Ice.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.400
If you wanna get horny, subscribe now.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.640
And come see for yourself.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.520
This is the guy I told you about

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.040
the sophomore who dropped out.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.360
So hot!

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.720
Back then, his leaked pics were everywhere online

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.920
The gays were all over him, getting off like crazy.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.640
He even had drama with a professor from our uni.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.000
He accused the professor of doing it.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.440
Are you serious?

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.160
But actually, he was hitting on the professor

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.760
even though the guy already had a wife and kid.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.240
And when the professor wouldn’t play along

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.480
he threw a huge tantrum.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.480
I don’t know.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.080
but it ended with the professor’s wife

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.960
having a miscarriage.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.480
and he got banned, so he dropped out.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.480
Next thing we knew, he was a porn star.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.560
But I heard he’s coming back to study in our year.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.039
I think whatever he films, that’s his own right.

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:13.160
But making false accusations

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.039
against the professor

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:15.640
that was way too much.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.200
Why would he even come back to study again?

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.160
Right?Right?

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.840
There he is!

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.440
Where? That one.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.440
He’s hot though. Oh my god!

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.840
So hot!

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.960
Is it still me that you love?

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:03.560
I still hold on to every promise

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.360
and my heart wants to hold you like yesterday.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.680
Change these cold nights

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.160
and bring us back to where we belong.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.840
That's all I want to ask.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.520
An Unwelcome Return

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.920
Big entrance, huh?

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.160
First day and you’re already famous

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.680
so fitting for Ice.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.200
Was it you who did the photos?

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.160
What?

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.880
Must’ve been rough, huh?

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.079
Printing out so many of them.

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:51.480
You must’ve watched all the porn films

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.000
I starred in, right?

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.720
Which one’s your favorite?

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.480
Hell no, who’d want to watch porn with you in it

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.840
I’m asking you seriously?

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:59.720
Do you even realize

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:00.840
how much trouble your comeback

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.800
has caused other people?

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.360
Especially Saint, my friend.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.000
Show some shame, will you?

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.000
What do you mean?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.480
Professor Sara specifically assigned Saint

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.600
to monitor your behavior

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.360
since he’s the class president.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.920
I never asked for that.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.440
This asshole’s just provoking me.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.640
What do you want, huh?

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.640
Huh?

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.720
Stop!

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.760
This is a university.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.120
If you want to fight, do it somewhere else.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.440
Tell your friend.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.040
I was minding my own business.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.440
It was your friends that picked a fight with me.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.680
Move.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.520
Picked a fight?

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.080
You were the one provoking me first.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Damn it.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.120
Hey! Stop filming right now.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.000
If you don’t

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.640
I’ll report you all for violating the PDPA law.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.840
You don’t need to worry your friend

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:24.920
will get in trouble

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.360
I’ve been bullied by the whole faculty

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.640
and he still couldn’t do anything

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.960
You don’t need to look after me.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.240
I’ll tell the professor myself

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.360
so we don’t have to keep running

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.240
into each other

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.840
Alright?

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.200
Wait, you two planned this just to mess with Ice?

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.440
No, man.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.280
We didn’t know anything.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.000
We were just reminding him, that’s all.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.760
Don’t you remember

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.120
what he did to Professor Mint last year?

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.720
But that still

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.880
doesn’t give you the right to do this to anyone.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.720
Shit, here comes the professor.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.960
Where are you all trying to run off to?

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.960
And what’s going on here?

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.600
Clear this up right now.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.560
Help clean up the floor, everything, now.

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.640
Hurry, pick it all up.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:15.200
Don’t just stare, clean it up, all of it.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.440
What a mess, are you really okay?

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.840
Are you sure you don’t want

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.960
to step in and resolve this?

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.200
Yes.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.200
But that won’t do.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.640
Either way

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.159
I need to deal with whoever did this to you.

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:41.200
Professor, can you not assign

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.480
Saint to monitor me?

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.440
No, yours is a special case.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.480
The committee made it clear,

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:55.200
a sophomore with good grades and maturity

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.520
must supervise and

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.000
be responsible for your conduct.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.480
Then can I pick someone else?

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.920
Besides Saint

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:05.200
do you even know anyone else in your class

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.240
or anyone who volunteered?

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.080
Oh, sorry.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.040
I'm sorry.

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.040
I didn’t mean it like that.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.480
I just meant Saint’s the right choice.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.960
He meets all the requirements, class president

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.560
good behavior, and excellent grades.

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.000
And I heard you two knew each other

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.440
even before university

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.520
With Saint watching over you

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.400
things should be easier, right?

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.040
Yes.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.920
Thank you, professor.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:54.560
I hope this semester will be a fresh start for you.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.159
Good luck.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.760
From the latest draft of my script

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.640
the story takes place in 1997

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.640
Kit lives with his biological mother Choon

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:08.440
and Sin

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.120
his stepbrother brought along by his stepfather

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:13.240
Kit and Sin’s love blossoms amidst hardship.

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.080
The main message we want to convey is love

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:19.840
in the shadows within a repressive society.

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:23.600
Not bad, the storyline and message are complete.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.240
But as I’ve mentioned before,

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.800
for student projects seeking

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.640
sponsorship from our company

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.560
a script alone isn’t enough

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:35.039
it has to align with our CSR.

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:38.799
Actually, my story touches on stigma reduction

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:43.559
and gives a voice to people at risk of suicide.

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:47.120
But every story has a message already.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.240
If it’s just the script

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.520
then I’m afraid we’ll have to pass.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.680
Wait a moment.

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.000
The casting is interesting.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.200
The actor playing Sin, is it Ice

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:21.040
the former porn star with leaked videos?

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:23.480
Those clips, Ice was forced to film them.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.680
I understand

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:29.240
I just personally want to give him a chance too.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.000
Our company values people

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.080
even those with troubled

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.760
pasts or who’ve been victims before

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.440
Everyone deserves a chance tofollow their dreams

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.240
and become actors too

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.240
As for CSR,

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.920
we can work on that later.

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:49.560
And the other lead actor, still not casted yet?

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.800
Give me two weeks, please.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.360
I’ll find someone.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.560
Can’t you do it sooner?

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.280
We want to submit the film to the

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.080
Youth Film Competition this year

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:01.680
And you’ll start shooting in two months, right?

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.520
Do you really think you have that much time?

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.640
Please secure the lead by this Friday.

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:09.360
Otherwise, we’ll have to give the opportunity

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:12.280
to another project that’s more ready.

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.120
No problem.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:35.760
Hey.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.480
How’d the pitch go?

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:45.520
Before that, tell me?

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.920
Who was that punk?

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:56.960
Mud, from my year, before I dropped out.

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:00.440
Where is he? I’ll take care of him.

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.440
Wait, calm down.

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:04.920
I can handle it myself.

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.240
Just didn’t expect things to blow up

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:08.400
so hard on the first day.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.480
And you’ve already got work stress

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.360
don’t add this on.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:17.240
Anyway, Midnight Sunday passed the pitch.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:20.040
I cast you as Sin, the lead.

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.360
But do they know about my past?

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:25.000
They do and they liked it.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.040
The only thing left is casting the other male lead

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.840
and we have to lock that in by Friday.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.880
So Ice, you need to help me with the casting tape.

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.920
But can I get through the next two days first?

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.480
I’m busy sorting out the dorm.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.040
Got a room already?

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:42.880
Yeah.

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.120
It’s awesome.

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:47.960
Wow.

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:49.120
14,000 baht a month

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.600
split in half, that’s 7,000 each.

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.560
But at least it saves a lot on travel costs.

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:53.920
Looks good though.

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:57.360
So who’s your roommate?

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.360
I don’t even know yet.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.280
The agent arranged it for me.

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:04.800
But I did give them a full list of conditions.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.600
I’m still confused

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:10.400
how a good roommateended up with me.

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.880
You’re really lucky, man.

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.440
Just let me have one good thing, please.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.080
I want some things to go right.

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.680
Well, you already got a good room.

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:17.920
As for the roommate

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:19.080
you’ll see if he’s good or not.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.760
Amen.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:21.760
Don’t pray to me.

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:25.080
I’m praying for a good roommate.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.880
(First day of the semester and here he is! )

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:37.800
("Hot upperclassman alert” with that top-tier aura)

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:42.000
(he should just be a star already.)

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.480
(That's him? The young stock market prodigy)

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:50.760
(heir to the real estate empire, “Saengarunwong.”)

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:06.520
Excuse me?

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:07.720
Yes?

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:10.160
I’m Ice, here to check in for the dorm.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:13.040
Aren’t Jack and Joke getting together anymore?

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:15.640
I’m still pissed they sent Noo Lek to the dumpster.

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.840
She was such a good actor.

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:19.120
Excuse me.

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:19.640
Excuse me.

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:21.680
Excuse me!

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:22.600
Hello.

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:23.520
Hi.

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:24.640
My name’s Ice.

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:26.560
Okay.I’m here for the check-in.

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:27.600
Your full name?

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:28.360
Karun.

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:29.360
Karan? Alright.

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:29.800
Karun.

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.040
Karun, Karun, Karun... Ok.

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:33.360
Got it, your name’s on the booking.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.080
Shall we go?

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:34.600
Yes.

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:37.480
Elevator’s this way.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.240
Come quickly, follow me.

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.960
Let me tell you something

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.360
your roommate is super handsome

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.200
super generous.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.960
Exactly what you asked for.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:48.880
And most importantly

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.480
he doesn’t bring people over.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:51.720
These days

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.280
good roommates are rare but I found one for you.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:58.840
It’s like the heavens gifted you this one.

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:01.680
Here we are, 803.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:10.040
Normally he’s back by now, classes are over.

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:13.720
Let’s try calling him.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:28.760
(Mina)

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:44.400
No answer, maybe he’s not home.

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.280
But no worries.

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:49.360
Oh! No key needed?

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:50.360
It’s not locked.

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:51.200
He must be inside.

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.720
Come in, come in.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.680
Follow me, Ice.

00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:00.640
Nice, huh? Spacious and grand.

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:01.200
Yes.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.920
Of course you’ll love it

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:06.720
I picked the best room for you.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:10.280
So that's why he didn't pick up.

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:12.560
He’s in the shower, water’s running loud.

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.920
Have a seat.

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:18.400
Let’s do the paperwork.

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.360
Here, sign this.

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.640
This is the dorm contract.

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:27.720
Trust me, I don’t scam.

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:29.400
Pretty, isn’t it?

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:32.280
If you like it, then transfer the money.

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:36.640
Three months upfront, 21,000 baht deposit.

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:37.880
Transfer now?

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:41.440
Yes, right now. Don’t be shy.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:44.800
Ah, perfect.

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.880
We’ll live comfortably,

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.240
like a family.

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:52.360
This room has two full air conditioners,

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:56.400
a huge TV, and also..

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:59.640
Oh my gosh, help me Lord!

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:01.120
Saint!

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:05.520
What are you doing here?

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:08.800
You two know each other?

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:13.600
This is the roommate you told me about?

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:20.920
There’s no way I can live with him.

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.480
I’m out.

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:26.920
Ice, calm down.

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:30.240
Wait, calm down and talk first.

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:32.160
Saint, what’s going on?

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:35.560
Ice, wait! Calm down, honey.

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:40.560
If not here, then where will you stay?

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.800
Anywhere but here.

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.720
That’s not possible.

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:46.400
You signed the contract.

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:48.840
The deposit’s non-refundable.

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:49.600
What?!

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:51.920
Don’t “huh” me

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:55.760
read before you sign next time.

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.200
(Dormitory contract: three-month deposit.)

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.400
(No refund if tenant cancels.)

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:00.400
See?

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:04.119
See?

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:08.839
No refunds.

00:17:08.839 --> 00:17:11.040
Here’s your key.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:16.359
Be happy, now it’s my time to watch Gel Boy.

00:17:16.359 --> 00:17:19.160
Stop holding back

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:22.960
just love first~ this version is the best.

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:40.360
Hi.

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:43.720
This is our room.

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:45.960
Balcony’s on the left.

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:48.640
That’s my room, and here’s the bathroom.

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:49.840
On the right is...

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:52.120
my room and the kitchen.

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:58.880
Shared areas, we both clean.

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:01.600
Private space, don’t cross boundaries.

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.440
Electric and water bills, we split equally.

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:08.720
So don’t live lavishly, save energy.

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.440
Okay.

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:13.560
Night time is for resting and homework.

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:15.760
So don’t make noise.

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:17.360
I don’t make noise anyway.

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:19.440
No outsiders allowed

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:21.280
first to break the rule moves out.

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:53.240
I'm not moving, you're the one moving out.

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:03.560
Mmm, smells so good.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:19.160
Smells good and tastes good.

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:25.560
Better share it with Cee.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:29.840
Might take a while, good food must be shared.

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:32.520
Be back soon, kids.

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:20.600
(So that’s why you two are avoiding each other?)

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:25.280
(Stop holding back, just love first~ Right?)

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:27.280
(Big kiss scene!)

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:31.000
Whoa, whoa!

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:34.920
Oh!

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:36.440
Oh my god, Ice, they’re on top of each other!

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:37.880
Really? On top?!

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:41.520
Oh, Saint, it’s just Mina, not an outsider.

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.040
Just me with a face mask on.

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:44.360
Not against the rules, right?

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:46.640
Let’s keep talking then.

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:47.200
Sure.

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.560
Wow, I’m loving this.

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:50.440
I like gel nails like these.Really?

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:52.040
I was thinking of getting mine done too.

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:55.280
But I’ll let them grow longer first.

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:56.920
What are you two talking about?

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:57.840
Let me join.

00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.160
It's about a BL series, do you even get it?

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:03.520
Gel Boy, right?

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:04.000
Yes.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:04.640
Here’s the story.

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.040
What is it about?

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:07.720
You watch it? Move closer.

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:10.000
So, there’s FourMod, Bua, Babin, and Cheer.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.200
Cheer likes Bua but Bua doesn’t like him back.

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:16.760
Then suddenly Cheer likes FourMod

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:19.040
so Bua pulls back.

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:19.840
It’s messy, see?

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:24.280
Look, look, this part.. see here?

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:27.000
It's so cool.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.480
Uh, why are you sitting on top of each other?

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:52.680
(Sorry, I haven’t bought a laundry basket yet.)

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.760
Where else could you find a roommate like this?

00:22:58.440 --> 00:22:59.520
Hey!

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:09.360
Shit, it’s broken.

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:11.280
Do you even know how much this costs?

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:14.880
I’m sorry, I really didn’t know it was in there.

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:17.800
I’ll get it fixed.

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:19.600
Do you really have that

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.360
big a problem with leaving me alone?

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:28.640
But I never planned on leaving your life.

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:31.520
Stop. I don’t want to argue.

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:34.040
Just stop bothering me and

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.680
don’t be nice to me either.

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:37.680
At least be consistent.

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:41.680
Keep to yourself, don’t cross my line again.

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:43.680
That’s it.

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:07.200
Do you know this leaves glue marks?

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:09.640
If the landlord fines us, I’ll pay.

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:11.800
Stop acting like you care about me.

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:58.080
(P'Warm)

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:15.160
(Ice: P’Warm, I’ll leave my guitar there first）

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:22.440
（I’ll come get it another day.)

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:28.000
(Ice: Also, I’m auditioning for the music club.)

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.760
(Ice: But don’t worry, I won’t mention you at all.)

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:33.760
(Ice: Even though you barely show up）

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:35.920
（to the club anyway.)

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:08.880
Hurts.

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:13.440
Don’t! Don’t!!

00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:18.520
I didn’t do it.

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:25.760
Dad, please! Dad, don’t hit me.

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:36.480
Stop! Get out!

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:41.360
I didn’t do anything.

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:44.200
Mom!

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:48.040
Hey! Anyone home? Can you hear me?

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:50.040
It’s time to pay up.

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:51.440
Hey!

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.520
Hey, check it out.

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.040
I’ll circle around back.

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:56.840
Should I climb the window?

00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:57.720
Can you hear me or not?

00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:59.320
(Saint: You should take care of your own life)

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:00.720
Hey, open up.

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.160
(Saint: I won’t throw away my future）

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:03.760
（for someone with no future like you.)

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:08.160
Hey! Can you hear me?

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:09.600
(Saint: Don’t contact me again.)

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:11.440
Hey.

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:13.920
Open the door!

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:16.200
Open the door, don’t make me mad.

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.880
Open it now.

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:24.040
Hey, open the door!

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:30.280
Saint!

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:33.520
Saint!

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:59.840
Saint!

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:17.360
Saint!

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:23.120
Saint!

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:33.880
Didn’t you say you’d never leave me?

00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:40.520
Didn’t you say you’d never leave me?

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:49.360
I never planned to leave you.

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:54.720
Ice.

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:25.040
Today’s the music club audition.

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:28.520
Anyone who is interested, step inside!

00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:30.520
Strong potential here, all three of you

00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:32.800
bright future.

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:35.280
How many did we get today?

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:36.160
About twenty.

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:38.360
Over twenty already, good turnout.

00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:40.680
(Warm: Sorry, just saw this.)

00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:42.320
(Warm: I don’t think you need to audition. ）

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:45.480
(You can just talk to me anytime.)

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:48.840
( Warm: ^_^)

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:58.640
Hey, that’s a freshman, right?

00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:01.080
Are you a first year?

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:05.440
Oh, I’m Pas, the club president.

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:08.520
So, are you here to audition?

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:12.440
Why don't you go inside?

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:15.240
Uh… no, I’ll pass, thanks.

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:18.760
Don’t be shy, I’ll take you in.Come on.

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:21.400
Don’t be shy.

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:29.840
This way. Come in.

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:31.480
Sorry, excuse me.

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:32.080
Sorry.

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:42.800
Mud is so cool, bro! Damn!

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:49.760
He can lift that, come on, show us!

00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:59.520
I’ll be back in a bit.

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:19.840
Wave for the crowd! Wave!

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:46.800
And that’s just a taste of our music club.

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:49.200
If you have passion and talent,

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:50.760
don’t be shy.

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:52.520
Come sign up and audition with us.

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:56.800
Our doors are open to everyone.

00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:01.040
But for you..

00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:04.040
we don’t take trash like you.

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:05.360
Get lost.

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:07.440
Then how did they accept you?

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:09.840
What do you mean by that?

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:10.640
Things always seem hard

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:12.040
to get through that thich skull of yours.

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:15.240
Are you mocking me?

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:17.120
Why don’t you think for once?

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:22.360
Wow, why don't you think for yourself?

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:25.200
Mus! Hey! Stop!

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.880
What are you trying to do?

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:29.440
This way, please.Thanks.

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:32.720
Hey, Saint, perfect timing.

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:34.720
I’ve got a question

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:37.160
about the budget for the songwriting contest

00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:37.960
how much did we get?

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:38.560
So we know

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:39.840
who we’ll invite as judges.

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:43.560
Not sure yet, we need to wait for the dean.

00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:45.280
That’ll take forever.

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:46.840
Hey, what the hell?

00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:47.800
You’ve crossed the line.

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:50.120
Mud, chill.That Mud’s voice?

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:52.640
Shit, is he picking a fight with a freshmen?

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:55.720
You want to fight?

00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:56.960
Mud! Stop!

00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:58.880
Mud!

00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:06.360
Pas, good to see you.

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:07.360
Been here long?

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:10.239
Long enough to hear you picking on freshmen.

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:15.400
Today’s recruitment day, can’t you behave?

00:34:16.199 --> 00:34:18.199
Sorry on Mud’s behalf.

00:34:18.199 --> 00:34:23.480
Our club welcomes talent and passion in music.

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:26.120
But Ice doesn’t seem to have either.

00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:28.520
Go look for another club.

00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:32.120
And what you just showed, you call that talent?

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:36.560
Wait, hey, kid. Shit…

00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:37.560
Calm down. Take it easy.

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:39.120
Don’t leave yet.

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:42.800
Mud, apologize to him.

00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:48.840
Go on.

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:52.440
Then let’s see it.

00:34:52.639 --> 00:34:57.800
Show us what you’ve got, Ice.

00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:05.160
Fine.

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:27.960
Hey! What are you doing?

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:55.640
(Do you still remember the day we were in love?)

00:35:55.640 --> 00:36:02.120
(I remember every second that I had you.)

00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:05.000
(I still see you so clearly.)

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:10.240
(All our things are still in the same spot.)

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:13.640
Hoooo

00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:18.080
(Even if our love ended, no matter how long ago,)

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:27.480
(that doesn't mean my heart can't start over.)

00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:33.160
(Is it still me that you love?)

00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:39.840
(Can it still be me that you miss?)

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:43.200
(My heart wants to hold you like yesterday.)

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:46.720
(Change these cold nights )

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:51.360
(and bring us back to where we belong.)

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:58.120
(That's all I want to ask.)

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:18.880
Ice, the song you sang earlier

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:20.400
did you write it yourself?

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:21.280
Yes, I did.

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:23.640
Wow, that was really impressive.

00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:26.840
I hope you don’t take Mud’s words to heart.

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:33.080
And congratulations, you passed the audition.

00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:37.640
Even if it wasn’t your intention. Yay!

00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:41.000
I’d like you to join our club.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:47.960
Thank you, but… no troublemakers, right?

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:51.480
Just Mud and Ten.

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:55.440
But if you mean Saint, he’s not in our club.

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:58.120
Why would you even invite Ice in, Pas?

00:37:58.120 --> 00:37:59.520
He’s a troublemaker.

00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:03.920
Well, if we accepted you and Ten,

00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:05.600
why not him?

00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:07.600
What?

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:10.720
It’s been a while since we had a strong songwriter.

00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:13.040
Help us? Ok?

00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:01.040
Gotta go.

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:02.400
He’s gone.

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:03.520
Come on.

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:04.600
What? Hurry.

00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:05.720
What? Quickly.

00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:10.760
Mud, what the hell are you doing?

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:12.200
That’s his bag.

00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:14.680
There’s no way a guy like him

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:17.000
could write good songs himself.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.400
I bet he copied from someone.

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:23.840
If we find proof, he’ll get kicked out of the club.

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:26.760
Better yet, maybe even the university.

00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:27.880
But if he didn’t copy,

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:30.640
then we’ll be the ones expelled.

00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:33.280
Just search, maybe we’ll find something.

00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:37.560
Still questions in my heart

00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:40.640
I’ve never spoken out loud…

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:43.360
What the hell is this?

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:46.000
I can’t even read it.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.200
Shit, he's coming.

00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:49.520
Quickly.

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:50.960
What the hell are you doing?

00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:53.880
Mud? What are you doing?

00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:54.720
Just a sec.

00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:56.120
He's near! He's nearly here!

00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:59.680
Come on Mus, let's go.

00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:07.960
(If you want it back)

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:09.560
(see you at 7pmat the side of the university.)

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:28.840
Hey.

00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:39.040
Give me back my notebook.

00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:43.640
Yeah, I'll give it back.

00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:45.320
But you have to proove

00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:47.400
that you didn't copy someone's song.

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:49.840
What right do you have to steal my things?

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:51.840
Give it back!

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:57.120
So many feelings we both keep inside.

00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:00.200
Wouldn’t it be better if you felt the same too?

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:06.120
Whoa, that gave me chills.

00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:09.360
My heart’s racing, really racing listening to that.

00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:11.360
Did you write it yourself?

00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:12.840
Here, next to it

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:13.960
he even wrote down happy memories

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:15.120
he did for the other person too.

00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:18.440
Ooh, who could that guy be?

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:20.000
Mind your own damn business.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.840
I said give me back my stuff.

00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:24.520
Hey, he’s mad now.

00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:26.280
Whoa, I’m actually scared.

00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:27.920
Mad?

00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:29.040
I think someone like you

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:30.840
doesn’t even need to be in school.

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:32.680
Just wasting a spot.

00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:35.240
All you do is cause trouble, nothing but a burden.

00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:37.200
Wherever you go, you bring people bad luck.

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:39.680
Even your parents didn’t want you.

00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:40.800
Bastard!

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:43.480
Shit, he really punched you!

00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:44.200
Let go!

00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:45.240
I said let go!

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:46.800
It’s my stuff, why are you messing with it?

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:47.680
You let go!

00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:48.440
I won’t let go!

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:49.440
Let go!

00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:58.840
You hit my friend?

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:03.520
You asshole!

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:04.720
No, you’re the asshole!

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:08.520
Ice!

00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:10.120
Mud! Ten! Ice!

00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:11.480
Damn it! Ice! Stop!

00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:11.880
Hey!

00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:12.680
What's wrong with you?

00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:13.240
Stop right now!

00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:13.760
What the hell

00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:14.440
Didn’t you hear me?

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:15.600
why do you keep messing with me?

00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:17.880
As the president of the student council

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:20.360
I’m ordering you two to stop!

00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:31.800
Lanee, you saw it right? He hit me first!

00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:36.120
This is Ice, right?

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.400
Tell me what really happened.

00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:42.640
We were just walking here.

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:44.280
And then he rushed up and punched me!

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:46.800
I asked Ice.

00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:56.000
Come on, talk it out properly

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.360
so there’s no misunderstanding.

00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:59.600
Ice!

00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:01.240
Look at him!

00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:03.240
Who does he think he is acting like that?

00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:05.120
You have to punish him!

00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:11.240
Mud, before you threw the punch, what happened?

00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:15.040
Did you provoke him?

00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:27.760
Why are you saying that?

00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:29.760
You’re supposed to be my friend!

00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:36.680
I said tell me the truth!

00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:01.840
It's all torn up.

00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:30.840
You dropped this.

00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:41.440
I told Mud no fighting on campus and

00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:44.840
he just goes and do it right beside school walls?

00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:49.520
The lyrics are pretty interesting though

00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:54.000
Wait? You read it?

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.720
How else would I know what it is?

00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:02.760
So many feelings we both keep inside…

00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:05.360
Are you mocking me?

00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:21.400
Damn it, let go!

00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:22.720
Calm down and just listen!

00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:23.960
I’m not listening!

00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:25.080
Where’d you even learn this move?

00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:26.440
What temple did you train at?

00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:28.600
Let me go, Saint!

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:30.760
If you don’t stop, don’t blame me for what happens

00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:33.200
I won’t stop, what will you do?

00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:35.040
Let go!

00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:36.480
Saint!

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:39.200
What are you doing?

00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:43.360
Are you crazy?

00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:45.920
Let me go, Saint!

00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:01.920
Don’t!

00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:07.080
Stay still!

00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:09.280
It hurts, Saint, let me go!

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:10.400
Why are you so strong?

00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:11.920
Saint, let me go!

00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:13.080
Stay still!

00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:16.880
What are you doing?

00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:26.920
Where are you going? Untie me first!

00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:28.000
Come back here!

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.120
Where are you going?

00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:32.040
Saint!

00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:48.440
What are you doing? Let me go right now!

00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:05.240
Leave me alone.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.360
You’ll just end up hurt.

00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:10.280
Why are you so stubborn?

00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:37.040
Hey, you’re too close.

00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:39.040
You’re crossing the line.

00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:48.960
Satisfied now?

00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:53.560
Tell me honestly

00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:55.920
do you really think I’d bully your song?

00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:57.920
What do you take me for?

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.520
Looking at me now

00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:02.920
that’s exactly the kind of person you are.

00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:34.840
I’m sorry, I know it’s not enough

00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:39.560
but still, I’m sorry.

00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:55.080
(P’Sea)

00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:02.920
Untie me first, P’Sea is calling, hurry!

00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:06.480
Nope, you’ll just punch me.

00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:08.240
Then how am I supposed to answer?

00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:12.120
Hurry! What if it’s something important?

00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:14.240
(P’Sea)

00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:22.680
Saint!

00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:25.160
Hello, Sea.

00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:27.160
(Hello, Ice.)

00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:31.040
Hi, what’s up?

00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:34.120
Saint, you bastard!

00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:36.040
You idiot! Damn it!

00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:38.360
Hello, Sea.

00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:39.120
Tomorrow at 3 PM

00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:40.960
come record the test casting for Sin’s role, okay?

00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:43.120
I already announced auditions for Kit’s role.

00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:44.720
A lot of people are interested.

00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:46.000
I’ve selected the ones I think

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.360
would match with you.

00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:50.520
Got it.

00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:59.840
Hey, Saint, come back and untie me first!

00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:01.120
Alright everyone, ready?

00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:02.280
I’ll be giving you a scene

00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:04.360
that’s a little different from the actual script.

00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:06.640
Look at scene eight.

00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:09.160
Sin, whose eyesight is failing

00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:11.360
tries to grab something to wipe his tears.

00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:13.440
He ends up picking up Kit’s shirt.

00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:15.600
Sin accidentally smells it without realizing

00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:17.760
just as Kit walks in and sees it.

00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:18.360
Any questions?

00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:19.080
Any questions?

00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:23.000
Don’t you think Kit is too harsh on Sin?

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:24.600
Such a red flag.

00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:27.880
True, but we have to understand

00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:30.640
that the social context backthen was different.

00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:33.000
He was under heavy pressure from society.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.240
So sexual aggression was stronger

00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:36.280
than in today’s world.

00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:38.400
That’s what our film is trying to show.

00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:39.840
Any other questions?

00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:42.920
If I play with my eyes closed like this

00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:44.240
how do I act?

00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:46.280
Just act like you can’t see your partner.

00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:48.440
The real Sin couldn’t see, he was in pain.

00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:50.840
This NC scene is crucial.

00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:54.720
We need an actor with fiery chemistry with you.

00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:56.400
Even if you can’t make eye

00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:58.040
contact with your partner.

00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:02.840
Basically, pick the person you feel the most with.

00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:08.240
Okay, let’s begin.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.000
Alright.

00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:14.680
Okay, first person, come on in.

00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:15.400
Three.

00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:16.240
Two.

00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:17.080
One.

00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:18.800
Action!

00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:22.160
Hey, what are you doing?

00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:24.400
Do you like me? Answer me!

00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:25.960
Cut!

00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:28.160
Okay, thank you, you can go now.

00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:33.160
Whoa, I just watched your clip, you were so hot

00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:37.680
Hey hey, please step out, okay?

00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:41.200
And how did you even get in here?

00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:43.280
Ice, are you okay?

00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:46.720
Ok?

00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:51.240
Okay, next person please

00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:54.600
Uh, sorry, who’s this?

00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:04.200
This is the last one, right?

00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:08.560
Yeah… if we still can’t find the right one, then...

00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:12.160
It’s fine.

00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:14.640
Yeah.

00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:16.280
Third person, you’re up.

00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:17.960
Here already?

00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:19.840
Oh, okay.

00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:22.720
Alright, everyone to your places.

00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:23.800
Ready?

00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:25.600
Okay.

00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:28.000
Third person, please.

00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:33.360
Three.

00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:37.120
Two.

00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:40.040
One.

00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:42.360
Action!

00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:52.880
What the hell are you doing?

00:53:57.480 --> 00:54:00.280
Nothing, I didn’t do anything.

00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:08.120
Don't! I didn't do anything!

00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:08.800
I didn't do it!

00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:09.840
No! I didn't!

00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:12.120
Give it to me!

00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:14.120
Let go, I didn’t do anything!

00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:15.960
Didn’t do anything? Then what’s this?

00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:20.600
Kit, are you inside, son?

00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:27.440
Kit!

00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:34.400
Kit!

00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:44.960
I heard him just now.

00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:14.120
You like me, right?

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:20.800
Answer me.

00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:07.160
Cut!

00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:10.840
That was wonderful!

00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:12.480
I loved it.That's was so good!

00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:13.760
Yeah.

00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:23.440
Saint... You..

00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:04.760
Are you a child?

00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:05.360
You're the child!

00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:06.360
You keep following me around.

00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:07.200
Why are you so confident?

00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:09.560
Then tell my why did you audition for this role?

00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:10.840
Can I ask you something?

00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:13.240
Can you return this diary to Ice for me?

00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:16.040
Reading someone else's diary is rude, you know.

00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:18.160
But I think there are some things you should know.

00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:20.640
Why do you like red sunflowers?

00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:21.840
Because it probably caught my eye

00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:23.000
the moment I walked in.

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:24.640
If that's the case, I'll be willing to work hard.

00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:26.320
I'll go study communication arts with you myself.

00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:26.960
What?

00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:29.520
Now that we're close, we can study together.

00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:30.880
If something's bothering you

00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:32.240
you can always come and talk to me.

00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:33.480
So, have you managed to get the money

00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:34.640
to pay off your father's debt yet?

00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:37.040
After that incident, I decided to drop out.

00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:39.600
I think maybe this shitty, broken life

00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:41.200
is probably fitting for someone unlucky like me.
