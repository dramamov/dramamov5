00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:55.560
This is exactly how I remember Meng Jia.

00:00:56.679 --> 00:00:59.640
But hasn't the Meng Jia manor
been abandoned for years?

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.840
How is that possible?

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.519
Even the orchids I planted as a child...

00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:15.799
Cheng Yi.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.439
Master, Madam.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.719
Yan is back.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.519
Yan, you finally came home.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.560
Cheng Yi...

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:25.439
You...

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.680
The Cheng Yi who cleaned the house?

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.480
She lost half her body...

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.359
Silly child.

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:31.359
Do you know

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.040
how worried they were
when you stayed away so long?

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:36.200
Master and Madam missed you so much.

00:01:38.879 --> 00:01:39.680
Dad.

00:01:40.879 --> 00:01:41.400
Mom.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.319
While you were gone,

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.319
Madam cried every day.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.920
Master was lost in thought all day.

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:50.760
Thank goodness you're back.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.200
You came back at the right time.

00:01:52.519 --> 00:01:53.439
Come inside, quickly.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.759
Do you remember

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:10.520
every year on your birthday,

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.560
we'd prepare a big table of food.

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:15.039
And your favorite fruit cake.

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:18.199
But you only ever ate the cake.

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.639
Happy birthday to you.

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:29.479
Happy birthday to you.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.439
Happy birthday to you.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.479
How are things over there?

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.560
I feel uneasy.

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:48.199
Something's not right.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.319
Don't act rashly.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.240
Find Meng Yan and Xiao Duo first.

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:58.719
Happy birthday to you.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.360
Yan.

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:19.360
Want to see your future?

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.960
Puppetmaster Toad.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.439
No matter what tricks you play,

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:22.599
it's time to end this.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.800
Let's check the study, then.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.840
Our Yan is about to be a college student.

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:38.599
It's his first time away for so long.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.960
If you need money, just tell us.

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:49.319
Don't hang out with shady people.

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:50.560
And also,

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:54.199
never show off our Meng Jia power.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:55.599
Understand?

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.080
Got it, Dad.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.039
We didn't let you date before

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.080
because we worried about your studies.

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:07.599
Now in college, date as many as you want.

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:09.319
Don't be stingy.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:10.360
Got it?

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:12.360
Dad, what are you saying?

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.519
This farce should end now.

00:04:23.519 --> 00:04:24.160
Meng Yan.

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:26.040
They're all fake, all puppets.

00:04:27.079 --> 00:04:27.959
I know.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.360
Then you...

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.759
Don't rush.

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:32.759
Yuer, calm down first.

00:04:33.079 --> 00:04:34.319
Give Meng Yan some time.

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:35.279
I'm here on this side.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.079
Is there more?

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:52.319
What?

00:04:54.079 --> 00:04:55.120
My life.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.480
Of course.

00:05:16.079 --> 00:05:16.680
Who?

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:24.439
You move pretty fast.

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:27.879
Sorry about that.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.000
Really sorry for earlier.

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:32.279
Looks like you're clear-headed now.

00:05:33.519 --> 00:05:34.519
Sister Yuer.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.639
No one could stay calm in that situation.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.639
But he knows I care about him,

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:41.720
yet he used Mind Control on me.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:43.800
So ungrateful.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.240
Thank you.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.040
I thank you.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.600
Why is it just like when we were kids?

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.120
So clueless.

00:05:54.959 --> 00:05:55.920
I know.

00:05:58.839 --> 00:05:59.759
You must still blame me.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.240
Blame you for what?

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.800
Blame me...

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.279
When you had trouble back then,

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.519
I didn't help you.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.079
Nothing in life goes as we wish.

00:06:12.079 --> 00:06:13.480
But you could have, later.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.480
No one in this world is like you.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.839
When did you get so smooth-talking?

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:30.759
You lie without even blushing.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.000
Darn it, I'll check over there.

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:39.920
Then I'll go look too.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.040
You know.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:42.720
I know everything.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.360
What do you know?

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.720
I can read minds.

00:06:57.399 --> 00:06:58.480
Then do you know

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.600
what I'm thinking right now?

00:07:04.279 --> 00:07:05.199
You're thinking

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.000
about things you shouldn't.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.240
Be more specific.

00:07:16.399 --> 00:07:17.680
You want to be with me...

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.120
I want to be with you...

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.160
Yuer.

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:41.000
Why are you like this?

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.079
I wish what you said was all true.

00:07:44.959 --> 00:07:46.120
And that you were real too.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.439
Puppetmaster Toad.

00:07:52.079 --> 00:07:52.879
You're right.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.000
Nothing in life goes as we wish.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.759
Truly a son of Meng Jia.

00:08:13.759 --> 00:08:15.000
So impressive.

00:08:15.279 --> 00:08:17.600
Standing on stage with your bride today,

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.560
that's a perfect match.

00:08:21.839 --> 00:08:22.879
From now on,

00:08:23.279 --> 00:08:25.519
we have one more daughter.

00:08:26.399 --> 00:08:27.759
Look how happy you are.

00:08:28.279 --> 00:08:30.279
Didn't you always want a daughter?

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.840
Will I be that bride?

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:38.279
Our little Meng Yan has grown up.

00:08:39.639 --> 00:08:41.000
A grown son can't be kept by his mother.

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:43.480
Once he starts his own family,

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:46.159
we'll see him less and less.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:49.120
Dad.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:50.919
Mom.

00:08:51.679 --> 00:08:52.120
Meng Yan.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.480
Calm down.

00:08:53.679 --> 00:08:55.080
None of this is real, it's an illusion.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:55.720
No.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:57.360
This is real.

00:08:58.279 --> 00:08:59.679
It just never happened.

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.559
If not for Shen Tianyi,

00:09:03.679 --> 00:09:05.440
I would have had a real life like this.

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.000
Together with my own parents.

00:09:13.919 --> 00:09:15.279
Do you want to know what happened
that night?

00:09:15.279 --> 00:09:16.600
Do you want to know what went down?

00:09:19.799 --> 00:09:20.879
Master Shen,

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:21.840
I'm begging you.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:22.759
Master Shen,

00:09:22.919 --> 00:09:25.440
Meng Jia will be yours from now on.

00:09:25.519 --> 00:09:27.399
We are at your mercy.

00:09:27.519 --> 00:09:29.720
But Yan is still just a child.

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.519
He's innocent.

00:09:31.519 --> 00:09:34.200
Please, spare him.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.000
Impossible.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:36.919
That's not true.

00:09:37.799 --> 00:09:39.000
Even if my dad were dying,

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.639
he'd never kneel before Shen Tianyi.

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:43.919
If you come over here

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:47.440
and lick my shoes clean,

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.480
maybe I could

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.399
let your son go.

00:09:52.799 --> 00:09:54.080
Master Shen,

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.759
I'm begging you, let him go.

00:09:56.279 --> 00:09:57.480
Let Yan go.

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.240
I'm begging you, Master Shen.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.919
Please, I'm begging you.

00:10:00.919 --> 00:10:01.960
Let Yan go.

00:10:02.639 --> 00:10:03.919
Knows my family inside out,

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.399
and can control puppetsâ€”

00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:09.440
it has to be him.

00:10:11.759 --> 00:10:13.159
I know who you are now.

00:10:13.639 --> 00:10:14.080
Come out.

00:10:27.799 --> 00:10:30.000
Long time no see, Meng Yan.
