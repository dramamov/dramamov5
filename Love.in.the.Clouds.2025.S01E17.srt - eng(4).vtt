00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.920
The last step of being the netherbeast vessel

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.040
is to refine the netherbeast core for seven days

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.560
once you absorb netherbeasts' primordial spirits

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:39.760
into your body

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.070
in order to contain them.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.150
However, this is why it's so dangerous.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.400
Refining the core

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.400
means suppressing each other

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.680
and fusing with them.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.920
In the end,

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.640
you'll either dissolve them

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.710
or be devoured by them.

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.070
Ji Bozai!

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.790
By using your body as a vessel

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:58.760
to refine us,

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.150
you'll also experience immense pain.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.560
Is it worth doing all this for the people of Jixing Abyss?

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.190
Is it worth it?

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.310
Is it worth it?

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.910
The emperor of Jixing Abyss is weak like a puppet.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.870
There's nothing you can change.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.080
Shouhua Academy's people used you as their champion,

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.710
but they never cared about the humiliation you endured

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.000
in the Sunken Abyss.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.120
Are you going to exhaust yourself for them?

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.840
You are such a fool.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.470
You are foolish!

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.800
Why must Ji Bozai cultivate in seclusion?

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.800
Your Highness,

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.710
Ji Bozai is fine now.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.080
He will come out of seclusion soon.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.840
Ming Yi.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.840
Ji Bozai promised to discuss things with me

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.190
if something came up.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:51.840
Why is he hiding things from me again?

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:53.430
In that case,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.360
I must really doubt his sincerity

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.800
as our ally.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:58.870
Sorry, Your Highness.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.960
Immortal Ji didn't plan to hide it from you on purpose.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.400
However, this involves many things.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.030
Please trust him one more time.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.190
I heard about the incident at Shouhua Academy.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.590
I didn't expect Your Highness to stabilize the situation

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.000
in such a way.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.360
This is all thanks to you.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.360
Sun Liao obviously did that

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.910
because of Uncle's instructions.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.310
He also gave you a hard time before that.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.840
It was all

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.680
to strip Ji Bozai of his position as a warrior.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.630
Ji Bozai was promoted to an immortal

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:35.840
because he was fighting for Jixing Abyss.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.150
If he's not in Shouhua Academy,

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.630
nothing will stop Uncle

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.590
from getting rid of him anymore.

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.190
However, Ji Bozai

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.030
has always liked fighting alone.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.400
He wasn't serious about his work at Shouhua Academy.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.000
Once Sun Liao fanned the fire,

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.800
everyone in Shouhua Academy

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.680
became unsatisfied with Ji Bozai.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.680
Your Highness, you had no choice but to take action

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.560
and strip Ji Bozai of position temporarily

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.280
to appease everyone.

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.000
Next, Your Highness

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.400
gave the position to Sun Liao.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.630
He was so excited about being the warrior

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.590
and forgot about Lord Hanfeng's plan.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.560
You have no idea

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.080
how embarrassing it was for me

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.910
to deal with Sun Liao.

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:14.680
I know.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.310
I understand.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:17.950
I get it.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.070
Can you tell me

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.000
when he's coming out of seclusion?

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.750
I can only deal with Sun Liao.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.830
I can't deal with Mu Qibai

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:29.950
if he does something now.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.830
Moreover, Jixing Abyss has seen a glimmer of hope

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.310
because of Ji Bozai's appearance.

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.190
The number of warriors who joined training this year

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.680
has multiplied.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:38.830
I dare say

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.360
that they've come to the academy because they admire Ji Bozai.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.870
Ming Yi.

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.040
How should I take responsibility for the disappointment

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:50.800
of these people toward Ji Bozai?

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:19.600
What's wrong?

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:20.750
I'm too tired.

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.040
I can't go on anymore.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.000
Chen Xi.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.000
Your cultivation isn't good enough.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Thanks to you,

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.360
everyone

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:36.800
must train for two more hours today.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.270
It's all because of you.

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.000
Spare me, please. I beg you.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:42.310
I don't want to train anymore.

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.040
- Is he trying to kill us? - Exactly.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.680
Stand up.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.480
It's not your fault.

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:48.120
He's just flaunting his authority.

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:54.600
Greetings, Venerable.

Venerable.

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:00.600
I've been training them

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.600
before the sun came up today.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.070
If we continue like this,

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.560
we'll surely win the Qingyun Tournament.

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.040
Immortal Sun Liao, you are so capable.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.240
I just made you the warrior

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:17.750
and you've changed Shouhua Academy completely.

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:19.870
However,

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:21.830
I still need to work today.

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:23.950
It's too noisy outside.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.360
Why don't all of you take a break?

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.830
Yes, Venerable.

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:38.430
Who told you to train so early?

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:40.000
Who was it?

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:40.720
You...

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:41.310

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:44.430
- I... - Shut up.

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:47.830

I must tell him

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:13.920
everything you've done.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.240
I believe Father will be willing

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:17.600
to leave Jixing Abyss

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.120
in the hands of a truly excellent individual.

I'm going to touch it.

Who was it?

Yes!

Don't let me catch you!

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:08.040
I'll skin you alive

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.160
and remove your veins!

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:10.630
Let's hide.

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:15.480

the Water of Five Poisons and Ten Destructions on you.

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:28.830
Five Poisons...

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:30.950
Your body will rot and die.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:32.320
Then...

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.320
will my face rot?

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:38.870
Yes.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.080
Then,

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.200
what should I do?

Don't worry, Sun.

If you eat...

However, once you eat it,

you will lose all your strength.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.200
You can only lie in bed

or stand.

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:58.840

why didn't you tell me sooner?

It's not an issue.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.120
See?

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.120
You're smart.

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:32.000
This worm can help you find the Golden Millet Dream, My Lord.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:35.030
If you release it into Wugui Sea,

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.080
it will head in the Golden Millet Dream's direction.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:39.440
If Ji Bozai

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.550
did create a real Spirit Well,

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:43.080
the worm will also lead you

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.550
to the entrance of the Spirit Well.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.750
It's very rare to see this worm.

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:48.320
How did you get it?

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:03.270
What happened?

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:07.030
The Moonlit Blossoms found me some useful intelligence,

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.080
so I went to Mangfu Swamp

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:10.600
to retrieve this.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.390
I'm talking about your hand.

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:20.150
I was discovered by the locals

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.200
and got a small injury.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:23.440
Look.

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:24.840
It's almost healed.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.600
There's no news of Ji Bozai currently at Shouhua Academy.

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.080
Sun Liao is sick.

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:38.270
Apparently,

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.440
he has had a stomachache for three days.

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:41.750
Perhaps he drank too much.

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:43.360
A few days ago,

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.600
Sun Liao was very happy.

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:46.910
Whenever he saw someone, he would say Princess Tianji admired him

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:48.440
and was going to choose him as her consort.

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:51.120
He has been drunk for days

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.120
so he feels weak.

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:56.720
Tianji admires him?

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.550
He actually believed her obvious trick?

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:02.390
What an idiot.

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:03.390
Does he think

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:04.550
Tianji is still the little girl

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:06.150
who can be easily coaxed?

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.440
Are you as foolish as Sun Liao as well?

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.200
Can't you tell

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:14.240
that Sun Liao went to cause trouble at Shouhua Academy

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:16.000
because I instructed him so?

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:18.910
I thought

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.080
that Sun Liao

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.480
would not forget your instructions

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:24.360
and would still do his best even if he was duped

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.440
by the princess.

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:27.270
That was why I didn't intervene.

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:29.910
However, I didn't expect him to be so gullible.

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:37.750
Yan Xiao.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.320
Do you know what your weakness is?

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:42.670
I am ignorant.

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:44.550
Please guide me, Lord Hanfeng.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.440
Some are evil at heart

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:49.870
and they use righteousness and morality as a cover.

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:52.240
You are the opposite.

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:55.080
You seemed like someone who'd do anything to get promoted

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.390
but you're not ruthless at all.

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:01.390
Yan Xiao,

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.240
you want too many things.

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:08.320
I'm always loyal.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.200
I had to abandon

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:11.240
my conscience

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:13.440
before I could negotiate with them.

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:15.480
If you can't do it,

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:17.750
you are useless to me.

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:29.840
I need to get Ji Bozai to compensate me for these plants.

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.480
This is the fourth day.

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:36.630
Ji Bozai,

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:38.600
are you doing well?

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:51.720
The netherbeasts will bring out your most painful memories

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.550
to bring out your inner demons.

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.150
You must stay firm

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:57.150
without wavering.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.120
If your consciousness is taken over by your inner demons,

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:02.000
you will lose control of yourself

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:03.480
and be taken over by the netherbeasts.

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:18.360
Haven't you thought about the possibility of her

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.000
using you and lying to you?

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:23.030
Do you actually still believe in the people around you?

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:25.440
Have you forgotten about your past in the Sunken Abyss?

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:39.430
Do you have water?

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:40.870
I can't take it anymore.

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:44.630
I can't move.

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:45.320
My hands...

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.750
My legs hurt.

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:51.030
Rest easy.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:54.200
You

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.630
look similar to my son.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.550
When he was ten,

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:01.840
he was beaten to death

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.790
just to fight for a meat bun.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:19.150
Your hands look like his.

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:21.200
When he died,

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:24.150
he was still holding onto that meat bun.

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:29.150
His hands

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:35.150
were trampled on.

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:40.600
I used all my strength

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:44.000
but I failed to save his hands.

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:47.840
Tell me.

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:51.600
If he died like that,

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:54.870
he might not be able

00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:00.120
to touch his mother's face

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:03.750
in his next life.

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:16.390
Sorry.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.600
My hands are too dirty.

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.750
You must be hungry.

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:29.840
Eat something.

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:35.600
It's fine.

00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:36.790
Just eat.

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:46.360
Is it delicious?

00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:50.390
Eat it slowly.

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:09.360
Can you

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.790
leave me a handprint?

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:15.910
I want to cherish it as a keepsake.

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:22.360
If you don't want to,

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.080
it's okay.

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:30.630
Wait.

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:38.240
Don't wipe your hand.

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:41.720
How can you leave your handprint otherwise?

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:01.320
Thank you.

00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:07.070
Thank you.

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.200
I tried to match everyone's handprint

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:17.400
and only yours is a perfect match.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.030
How dare you beat me?

00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:20.480
You have a death wish!

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:22.070
Die!

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:24.400
Look.

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:26.200
You left a handprint.

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.590
How arrogant.

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:30.310
Today,

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:32.550
I will beat you to death.

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:49.110
My son,

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:51.310
none of those who went to refine medicine

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:54.830
has come back alive.

00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:58.440
I can't see you die.

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.440
I have no choice but to find you a scapegoat.

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.070
After he offends the supervisor,

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:06.480
he will surely be the one

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.440
to be chosen to make the medicine.

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:26.440
Immortal Hou Zhao.

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:29.480
Where's the new substitute who will be making medicine for me?

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:32.200
He's here.

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:41.920
Sorry.

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:45.310
Sorry, child.

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:48.240
It was either you or my son.

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.550
Don't trust other people anymore.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:07.590
Ji Bozai,

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:10.750
you are surrounded by lies!

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:12.640
Deceit!

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:14.200
Don't you hate them anymore?

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:16.550
What you've been through...

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:20.270
The worst of humanity...

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.750
Have you forgotten?

00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:25.680
This world full of evil

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:28.270
has already abandoned you!

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:30.790
Ji Bozai!

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:32.790
How dare you slack off?

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:34.750
How dare you!

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:36.720
Try slacking off again!

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:39.830
What?

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:41.240
Faster!

00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:43.240
Faster!

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:47.440
This is

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:48.640
the last step.

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:49.790
Don't slack off.

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:56.750
Catch him!

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:58.000
Don't let him escape!

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.920
Stop running!

00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:03.440
Catch him!

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:04.070
Hurry!

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:05.110
- Don't run! - Don't run!

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:08.880
Where did he run off to?

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:12.550
Run!

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:13.590
Run further!

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:17.550
Why have you stopped running?

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:19.270
Brat!

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:21.480
I'll beat you to death today!

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:02.550
Let go!

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.880
Let go!

00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:05.920
Yes.

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:07.270
Yes.

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:08.350
That's right!

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:09.270
That's right!

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:10.830
That's right!

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:19.350
See that?

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:22.960
This is the law of survival in this world.

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.200
Only by taking revenge

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:27.350
and trampling on them

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:31.000
will you not be bullied.

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:36.310
We have the strongest power in the world.

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:37.960
With us,

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:40.200
you can do anything.

00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:42.160
Ji Bozai,

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:46.400
join us.

00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:49.310
We can give you everything.

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:52.400
Everything you want!

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:54.830
Let us

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.640
stand on the peak of Six Realms!

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:08.380
[Pure and Noble Spirit]

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.920
Tianji, you are finally here.

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.200
Ji Bozai

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:25.000
has not shown himself in the last few days.

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:27.480
Everyone in Shouhua Academy feels tired and demoralized.

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:28.960
I figured

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:30.550
it's too difficult

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:32.000
for a fairy like you

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:33.750
to be in this position.

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.070
This is great.

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:38.000
I've requested a decree

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:40.880
to relieve you of this responsibility at Shouhua Academy.

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:42.960
Isn't it better to become

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:44.070
an idle princess?

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.070
Read it out to everyone.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:52.880
As per His Majesty's decree,

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:55.550
the Venerable of Shouhua Academy is incapable of leading her warriors...

00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:56.830
Father has been sleeping for many days.

00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.590
Lord Hanfeng, how did you obtain

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:02.790
the Father's decree to dismiss me as the Venerable?

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.750
You impress me.

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:09.680
I suppose I must meet my father in the palace

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:11.110
to confirm this.

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:13.640
Tianji, I'm sure you know

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:15.240
that your father is ill.

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:15.790
He can't...

00:24:15.790 --> 00:24:17.920
Lord Hanfeng, you came here on official business.

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:20.590
Why are you addressing me with my name?

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.270
Are you

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:25.270
trying to mix official and private matters into one?

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:28.110
You talk to me

00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:30.960
as if I'm just your niece

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:33.110
so all of Shouhua Academy

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:35.750
no longer trusts me as the Venerable.

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:41.550
Lord Hanfeng,

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.880
you said Father was ill

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:45.590
and asleep,

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:47.920
yet you could meet him.

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.030
Why don't you

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:53.880
lead me to Father?

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.920
We will be waiting at Ziwei Hall.

00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:58.960
We will decide

00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:01.070
when Father is awake. How's that?

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:02.960
Witty, aren't you?

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:07.160
If you are capable

00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:08.830
of running the Shouhua Academy,

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:10.960
you ought not to lose sight of Ji Bozai

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:12.440
and let him do whatever he wants,

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:15.200
sinking everyone's morale in the academy.

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:16.480
Do you think

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:19.400
you are still a competent venerable?

00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:22.830
In that case,

00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:25.240
if I can bring Ji Bozai here,

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:27.270
will you think

00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:28.880
that I'm good enough

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.790
to be the Venerable of Shouhua Academy?

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:31.830
Of course.

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:36.200
Did someone mention me?

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:44.880
How unexpected.

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:48.440
You've missed me so much, Qibai.

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:49.400
Your Highness,

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:51.000
come on now.

00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:52.440
If you had told me sooner,

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.070
I would've come sooner.

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:57.350
I was just cultivating in seclusion back home for a few days.

00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:59.110
Did you miss me that much, Qibai?

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:02.160
Your Highness,

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:04.550
it takes seven days to refine the netherbeast core.

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:06.750
However, Ji Bozai will do his best.

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:08.400
He'll do it in five days

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:09.720
and not give Mu Qibai

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:11.790
any chance of taking over the Shouhua Academy.

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:17.030
All right.

00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:18.910
All right, now.

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:23.400
With my cultivation,

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:24.830
it doesn't take me long

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:26.550
to refine some netherbeasts.

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:28.820
Who are you to try to stop me?

00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:33.200
Reassured now?

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:36.960
With you around,

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:39.830
I'm not worried.

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:44.590
Let's go.

00:26:57.550 --> 00:26:58.720
[Pure and Noble Spirit]
In the last five days,

00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:00.830
my husband has been living in seclusion

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:01.920
to improve his cultivation.

00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:03.920
As you all know,

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:06.070
it is very difficult

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:07.270
for warriors of the Transcendent Stage

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:08.640
to improve to the next stage.

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:11.000
Within the Six Realms,

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:13.000
no one has broken through the Perfected Stage.

00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:15.750
Immortal Ji has been working hard to achieve this.

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:17.750
It's hard to obtain the Perfected Stage.

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:19.030
Immortal Ji only needs a bit more

00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:20.070
to ascend further.

00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:23.310
You have earned our respect, Immortal Ji.

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:24.750
Yes. As expected of him.

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:25.880
- He's amazing. - Yes.

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:27.350
Immortal Ji has always been cautious.

00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:29.480
There was no progress previously

00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:31.030
so he asked me to keep it a secret.

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:33.160
After five days of cultivating in seclusion,

00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:34.270
he has finally achieved a breakthrough

00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:35.960
so he rushed to Shouhua Academy immediately

00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:37.720
to share his insights with everyone.

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:39.350
Today,

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:42.000
I will restore Immortal Ji's position as a warrior.

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:45.270
All of you should ask for his guidance.

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:47.200
He will share everything.

00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:51.070
Congratulations, Immortal Ji.

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:51.720
Congratulations, Immortal Ji.

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:52.640
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:53.830
Congratulations, Immortal Ji.

00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:55.440
Immortal Ji.

00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:57.120
- Quick, go over there. - I have a question.

00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:58.360
- Me too. - Immortal Ji.

00:27:58.360 --> 00:27:59.750
- I have a question. - Immortal Ji.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.160
- Immortal Ji, look at mine. - Immortal Ji.

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:04.350
I haven't improved for many days.

00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:05.200
Help me take a look.

00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:06.000
Me too.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:06.490
Look at mine.

00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:07.170
I don't know

00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:08.030
when I can reach the next stage.

00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:09.350
Help me take a look, Immortal Ji.

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:10.640
Immortal Ji.

00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:12.680
Immortal Ji, my cultivation has been stagnant.

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:13.370
What should I do?

00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:14.440
- Help me take a look. - Immortal Ji.

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:16.270
- Help me take a look. - Everyone, make way.

00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:20.000
Help me take a look.

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:24.590
Although you have become stronger,

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:27.550
refining the netherbeast core hastily still took a toll on you.

00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:30.960
Don't worry, I'm still alive.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:32.880
Since I'm already here,

00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:34.440
I should help Tianji out.

00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:38.640
Ji, I've been waiting for you to come back.

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:40.550
You must teach us more in the future.

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:42.030
That's right, Ji.

00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:43.440
I have a wonderful artifact.

00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:45.830
I hope it can help you out

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:47.400
after your return.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.110
Netherbeast-Luring Caltrop?

00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:17.310
Netherbeast-Luring Caltrop?

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:19.090
Netherbeast-Luring Caltrop?

00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:19.760
Meng Yangqiu!

00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:22.240
Do you know

00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:25.000
that netherbeasts appeared in Jixing Abyss not long ago?

00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:30.440
Ji Bozai is that kind of person?

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:34.310
Your Lordship.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:39.830
This is...

00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:41.200
Netherbeast-Luring Caltrop.

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:48.440
It is very sensitive.

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:50.550
You must take good care of it.

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:53.440
Find a chance and make Ji Bozai open it.

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:56.000
After that, we will find out

00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:58.240
whether he is a blessing

00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:02.240
or a misfortune for Tianji.

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:08.790
Ji Bozai.

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:13.830
There's netherbeast energy.

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:15.880
Why is this happening?

00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:17.350
Be careful.

00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:19.480
What should we do?

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:24.480
Move.

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:27.310
This...

00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:41.960
Ji Bozai.

00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:43.210
Don't worry, Your Lordship.

00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:45.900
I infused netherbeast energy in the Netherbeast-Luring Caltrop.

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:49.060
Even if Ji Bozai can refine the netherbeast core ahead of schedule,

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:49.990
the core's still not stable.

00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:53.470
We can use the netherbeast energy to lure out the core.

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:02.660
Netherbeast-Luring Caltrop can sense netherbeast energy.

00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:04.660
Is Ji Bozai raising netherbeasts?

00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:07.140
Netherbeast marks?

00:31:08.030 --> 00:31:08.790
No wonder

00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:10.710
netherbeasts were killing people in Jixing Palace.

00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:12.900
It was all because of Ji Bozai.

00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:19.860
There's netherbeast energy. It must be true.

00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:22.420
I thought you'd be safe.

00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:24.100
I didn't expect

00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:26.620
you to raise netherbeasts.

00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:33.660
Ji Bozai, you...

00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:34.420
Stay away.

00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:41.230
That's...

00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:43.530
He's gone.

00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:45.580
Tianji.

00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:47.620
All of us have been lied to by Ji Bozai.

00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:49.470
He has been raising netherbeasts.

00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:51.710
This must be true.

00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:53.030
He has been raising netherbeasts.

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:54.030
We saw it ourselves.

00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:54.710
It's him.

00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:55.470
He raised netherbeasts.

00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:56.270
He raised netherbeasts.

00:31:56.270 --> 00:31:56.950
Fools!

00:31:57.230 --> 00:31:58.660
If Ji Bozai raised netherbeasts,

00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:00.310
he could have found any excuse to avoid you.

00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:01.750
Why would he come to the Shouhua Academy today?

00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:03.270
But the netherbeast energy proves...

00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:05.270
It only proves that someone is trying to frame Ji Bozai.

00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:06.190
That's...

00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:17.270
Frame him?

00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:43.510
Ming Yi, calm down!

00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:45.510
If you use the heart imprint to trespass into his Spirit Well now,

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:46.750
you'll reveal to him

00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:48.310
that you know its location.

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:50.060
Ji Bozai has strong spiritual powers.

00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:51.660
He will be fine.

00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:54.510
Ming Yi!

00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:08.510
I got in too.

00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:10.190
Is it because he's dying?

00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:13.860
Ji Bozai.

00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:17.510
Ji Bozai.

00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:18.140
Be careful.

00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:19.510
Buxiu.

00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:21.710
- Are you affected by the Netherbeast-Luring Caltrop too? - Buxiu.

00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:22.860
Don't you recognize us?

00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:24.060
Calm down.

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:25.470
Be polite.

00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:29.270
Sir...

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:45.420
Ji Bozai.

00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:48.550
Ji Bozai.

00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:50.950
Ji Bozai.

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:57.340
The Netherbeast-Luring Caltrop caused the netherbeast core to leak.

00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:58.470
We must dig it out of him.

00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:00.550
Otherwise, the Netherbeast Refining Skill will be in vain.

00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:04.340
You can't use your spiritual veins right now.

00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:07.230
Twenty-Seven.

00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:09.150
Help me do this together.

00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:14.110
Hurry.

00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:25.710
This is bad.

00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:28.020
When Ji Bozai was hit by the Netherbeast-Luring Caltrop,

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:28.900
he didn't set up any defenses.

00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:30.590
It was planted deep inside.

00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:32.070
If we remove it from him,

00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:34.340
Ji Bozai will be greatly weakened even if he survives.

00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:47.900
Has Ji Bozai truly created a Spirit Well

00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:50.710
to hide the Golden Millet Dream?

00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:53.590
This should be the entrance.

00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:55.900
However, besides him,

00:34:56.670 --> 00:34:57.590
only the person

00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:01.070
who shares a divine consciousness with him can enter.

00:35:02.110 --> 00:35:03.670
So, Ming Yi married him

00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:04.900
and obtained the heart imprint

00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:07.590
for the Golden Millet Dream too.

00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.900
That's great.

00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:14.300
She isn't in love with him after all.

00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:16.780
No matter what,

00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:19.150
I must do everything I can to help her achieve her goal.

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:46.380
Ji Bozai.

00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:48.030
Ji Bozai.

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:53.990
Ji Bozai.

00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:05.110
Ji Bozai.

00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:13.460
Where is Buxiu going?

00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:16.460
He is going to Dragon Carp Terrace to stall Mu Qibai.

00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:19.540
Where are you going?

00:36:20.110 --> 00:36:21.460
If you use your spiritual veins again,

00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:23.020
you will be injured.

00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:24.420
Ji Bozai's condition is stable now.

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:25.380
I'm going to find Buxiu.

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:26.310
Take care of him.

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:31.110
Your Lordship,

00:36:31.310 --> 00:36:32.500
we have gathered all the guards.

00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:34.230
We can capture him at Wugui Sea now.

00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:37.940
A silver dragon?

00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:55.500
That silver dragon

00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:57.270
is Ji Bozai's companion beast.

00:36:57.820 --> 00:37:00.150
Trying to stall time for Ji Bozai?

00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:02.630
He has walked straight into it.

00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:04.020
Everyone,

00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:06.710
Ji Bozai told his companion beast to show its true form

00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:08.710
to stop us from sealing the netherbeasts.

00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:11.150
This is all to protect Jixing Abyss.

00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:12.540
Kill it!

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:13.230
Get into formation!

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:38.420
Your master is already dying.

00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:40.940
Are you still dreaming of the impossible?

00:37:58.710 --> 00:37:59.900
These lowlifes.

00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:19.980
Such a powerful spiritual power.

00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:22.860
Is Ji Bozai so powerful

00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:25.380
that he is immune to the Netherbeast-Luring Caltrop?

00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:24.710
Ming Yi, let me help you.

00:39:56.070 --> 00:39:56.750
Your Lordship!

00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:14.150
Ming Yi.

00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:20.310
Ming Yi, you spent too much spiritual power.

00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:21.590
I'll bring you to seek aid.

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:25.270
Lord Hanfeng accuses Immortal Ji of raising netherbeasts.

00:40:26.270 --> 00:40:27.590
You're going against him

00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:28.900
just to help me?

00:40:29.590 --> 00:40:30.900
You protect Ji Bozai

00:40:31.710 --> 00:40:33.900
because you believe he doesn't raise netherbeasts.

00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:35.750
If you believe in him,

00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:37.420
I'll believe in him

00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:39.310
because I know

00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:41.500
you are not someone who wants the power of netherbeasts.

00:40:42.110 --> 00:40:43.980
If someone commits a crime,

00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:45.980
I'm sure you won't forgive him.

00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:48.940
Ming Yi, trust me.

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:50.750
Let's get you treated.

00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:52.900
Thank you.

00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:53.860
I'm fine.

00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:55.750
Let me check on Immortal Ji.

00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:57.070
Be careful.
