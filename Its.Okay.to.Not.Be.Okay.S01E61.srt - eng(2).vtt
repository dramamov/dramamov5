WEBVTT

00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:02.877
-You don't want it?
-You're more important to me.

00:00:02.961 --> 00:00:06.005
Madeth! Just keep looking for
Mia's mother's manuscript.

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:07.424
I'm not showing you this

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:09.342
until you stop being mean to me.

00:00:09.426 --> 00:00:11.970
If my forgiveness is
what it takes to bring you back to us,

00:00:12.053 --> 00:00:13.763
I will forgive you over and over again.

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:14.973
Mia, we shouldn't be torn apart

00:00:15.056 --> 00:00:17.600
for a sin we didn't even commit.

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:21.187
You think either
Olivia or Eden could be my mom?

00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:22.856
They're a threat to your life.

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:23.898
Let's face them.

00:00:23.982 --> 00:00:26.109
Eden hasn't come to work for awhile.

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:28.945
Ever since we found
that butterfly on Matmat's painting.

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.280
She just suddenly left.

00:00:30.363 --> 00:00:31.781
She's working with Mister Dipong.

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:35.368
He's the only one with access
to the house, so I'm sure he did this.

00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:34.344
I'll take you to Miss Li's
so you won't be alone.

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:37.263
I'm going to see
where Mister Dipong is,

00:01:37.347 --> 00:01:38.932
so we can find Ma'am Olivia.

00:01:39.641 --> 00:01:40.642
Why?

00:01:40.725 --> 00:01:43.186
Because you think
that woman could be my mother?

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:44.312
Is that what you're saying?

00:01:44.395 --> 00:01:47.941
We're only know Olivia
has a connection to Mister Dipong.

00:01:48.024 --> 00:01:50.860
But whether
Mister Dipong was involved or not…

00:01:52.237 --> 00:01:53.738
That we're not sure of.

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:56.783
Whatever.

00:01:56.866 --> 00:01:58.284
I'm not scared.

00:01:58.368 --> 00:01:59.619
I'll be fine.

00:01:59.702 --> 00:02:01.454
I can defend myself.

00:02:01.538 --> 00:02:02.831
Mia, don't fight me on this.

00:02:02.914 --> 00:02:04.958
Why don't you want me--

00:02:05.542 --> 00:02:07.168
Wait. It's Dr. Anok.

00:02:08.878 --> 00:02:10.004
Hello, Doc?

00:02:10.088 --> 00:02:11.256
Uh, Patrick…

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.967
Please come to the OK Hospital.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.385
I need your help.

00:02:22.725 --> 00:02:24.978
The face in the footage isn't visible

00:02:25.061 --> 00:02:27.438
of the person who drew on Matmat's mural.

00:02:35.864 --> 00:02:37.740
How can we know who this is?

00:02:51.296 --> 00:02:52.547
I know who it is, Doc.

00:02:53.548 --> 00:02:55.675
That woman is wearing a wig.

00:02:55.758 --> 00:02:58.177
That's Ma'am Olivia. It's her.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.638
Hey, where are you going?

00:03:00.722 --> 00:03:01.723
I'm going to Ma'am Olivia's.

00:03:01.806 --> 00:03:04.684
I'll go there and put an end to this.

00:03:04.767 --> 00:03:06.060
All right.

00:03:06.144 --> 00:03:08.021
I'll call the police.

00:03:15.445 --> 00:03:16.738
Hello, Doc?

00:03:16.821 --> 00:03:18.072
I'm almost there.

00:03:18.156 --> 00:03:19.866
The police are on their way too.

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:21.868
Take care, Patrick.

00:03:21.951 --> 00:03:23.620
Okay, Doc.

00:03:27.957 --> 00:03:29.584
Hello, Patrick?

00:03:29.667 --> 00:03:30.752
Hello, Mia!

00:03:30.835 --> 00:03:32.378
Don't leave the house, okay?

00:03:32.462 --> 00:03:34.422
Why? What happened?

00:03:35.006 --> 00:03:36.925
It was Ma'am Olivia
who drew on Matmat's mural.

00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:38.301
I'm on my way to her house.

00:03:38.384 --> 00:03:40.470
What? I'm going there too--

00:03:40.553 --> 00:03:42.305
No, Mia. Just stay there.

00:03:42.388 --> 00:03:43.890
Don't be stubborn, Mia.

00:03:43.973 --> 00:03:45.225
But, Patrick…

00:03:45.308 --> 00:03:46.976
Just stay there and wait for my call.

00:04:57.839 --> 00:05:00.383
-I'm here for Ma'am Olivia.
-Sir! It's off-limits.

00:05:01.426 --> 00:05:03.594
I work with Doc Anok,
the one who sent you here.

00:05:03.678 --> 00:05:05.138
I'm sorry, but you're not allowed here.

00:05:05.221 --> 00:05:06.556
I just want to talk to Ma'am Olivia!

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:07.890
Sir! Sir!

00:05:07.974 --> 00:05:09.767
Sir!

00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:10.852
Sir!

00:05:11.894 --> 00:05:13.855
Officer, I need to talk to Ma'am Olivia!

00:05:13.938 --> 00:05:14.939
You're too late.

00:05:15.023 --> 00:05:17.692
Olivia left already.
She took all her stuff.

00:05:17.775 --> 00:05:18.693
Huh?

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:23.883
Patpat's been
standing there for a while now.

00:06:23.966 --> 00:06:26.135
Why is Patpat standing there?

00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:32.308
Uh…

00:06:37.605 --> 00:06:39.315
Matmat, do you remember when,

00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:42.318
you helped Sir Tommy with his trauma?

00:06:43.027 --> 00:06:46.948
A-And then Dr. Anok said,

00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:50.993
"You're a hero, Matmat."

00:06:52.328 --> 00:06:54.122
Yes, Matmat. You were a hero.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:59.418
Can you be brave
again in the coming days?

00:07:03.047 --> 00:07:05.133
Brave again?

00:07:05.675 --> 00:07:11.097
Why does Matmat need to be brave again?

00:07:11.973 --> 00:07:13.641
You need to be brave

00:07:13.724 --> 00:07:16.936
if Ma'am Olivia or Ma'am Eden
try to come near you.

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:23.234
Why, Patpat?

00:07:24.777 --> 00:07:26.112
They're nice.

00:07:26.195 --> 00:07:32.326
They gave Matmat, Mama Dinosaur.

00:07:34.203 --> 00:07:36.497
Matmat, they're no longer
nurses at OK Hospital.

00:07:37.874 --> 00:07:40.126
They don't work there anymore.

00:07:40.209 --> 00:07:45.715
They did some
things that hurt other patients.

00:07:48.634 --> 00:07:52.096
They should have followed the rules

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.391
and taken care of the patients.

00:07:55.808 --> 00:07:56.893
That's right, Matmat.

00:07:58.519 --> 00:07:59.729
Matmat, listen to me.

00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:03.065
I don't want them to come near you, okay?

00:08:03.608 --> 00:08:05.568
They might do something bad to you too.

00:08:07.278 --> 00:08:09.989
Okay, Matmat won't go

00:08:10.072 --> 00:08:14.118
with Ma'am Olivia and Ma'am Eden.

00:08:14.202 --> 00:08:20.333
Matmat will only go
with people we know and trust.

00:08:26.005 --> 00:08:27.507
Thank you, Matmat.

00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:29.759
If you do that…

00:08:31.636 --> 00:08:33.346
you'll be brave for Patpat too.

00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:40.978
We're telling you this
because you're important to us.

00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:44.565
So you'll know what
we're facing right now.

00:08:45.608 --> 00:08:48.319
So you can help us
protect Matmat from my mother.

00:08:48.778 --> 00:08:53.157
If she's still alive, or if it's true
that she's either Eden or Olivia.

00:08:53.991 --> 00:08:55.493
W-wait a minute,

00:08:55.576 --> 00:08:57.787
I know you don't want
anything to do with your mom.

00:08:58.579 --> 00:09:00.373
But isn't this just overthinking?

00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:05.294
Boss V, it really isn't overthinking.

00:09:05.378 --> 00:09:06.921
Imagine,

00:09:07.004 --> 00:09:10.967
you thought your mom was dead,
and then suddenly, whoosh,

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:13.553
two people show up
acting like they might be her.

00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:16.180
What if they're just working together?

00:09:18.057 --> 00:09:20.268
What if neither of them is Ma'am Ingrid,

00:09:20.351 --> 00:09:23.020
and they're just
working together to mess with Mia?

00:09:23.854 --> 00:09:25.606
But why would they do that

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:28.109
if they've had nothing to do with Mia?

00:09:28.693 --> 00:09:30.194
Fame, Miss Li.

00:09:30.278 --> 00:09:31.612
People want fame nowadays.

00:09:31.696 --> 00:09:34.907
Isn't that what they all want,
fame and money?

00:09:35.616 --> 00:09:38.286
To extort money out
of Mia and leave her alone.

00:09:38.369 --> 00:09:40.037
That is a possibility.

00:09:40.121 --> 00:09:41.497
Since Mia is a celebrity.

00:09:41.831 --> 00:09:44.542
They could kidnap her and extort money.

00:09:44.625 --> 00:09:48.754
But isn't it hard to pretend
to be enemies for that long?

00:09:48.838 --> 00:09:51.591
When I arrived at OK Hospital,
Ma'am Olivia and Eden

00:09:51.674 --> 00:09:53.843
were already going at each other.

00:09:55.011 --> 00:09:57.388
I just don't want any of
you to get caught up in this.

00:09:58.347 --> 00:10:00.933
If it's just me, I don't care.

00:10:02.101 --> 00:10:03.144
I can handle them.

00:10:07.315 --> 00:10:09.275
But you all need to be careful, okay?

00:10:11.652 --> 00:10:13.446
You're like children to me.

00:10:15.072 --> 00:10:18.159
If anyone dares hurt even one of you…

00:10:18.993 --> 00:10:21.203
there will be hell to pay.

00:10:31.339 --> 00:10:32.673
Wow.

00:10:33.382 --> 00:10:34.634
Matmat.

00:10:35.176 --> 00:10:37.261
You finally drew a butterfly.

00:10:38.721 --> 00:10:40.014
It's beautiful.

00:10:44.727 --> 00:10:46.103
Yes, Doc.

00:10:46.896 --> 00:10:49.231
Matmat drew it.

00:10:51.442 --> 00:10:52.818
It's beautiful, Matmat.

00:10:55.196 --> 00:10:58.324
Matmat, you're doing a good job, huh.

00:10:58.991 --> 00:11:01.160
Even with our therapy sessions.

00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:07.124
Did Matmat do a good job, Doc?

00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.336
Yes, I'm super proud of you.

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:14.673
It's rare for someone
like you to overcome this.

00:11:15.633 --> 00:11:21.680
Doc, Mia and I finished our book too.

00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:25.559
Please come to the book launch.

00:11:31.023 --> 00:11:33.234
Of course, I wouldn't miss it.

00:11:36.404 --> 00:11:39.615
This painting isn't finished yet.

00:11:39.698 --> 00:11:42.910
I still have to draw some plants,

00:11:43.494 --> 00:11:46.580
and some birds.

00:11:55.131 --> 00:11:56.215
I'm sorry, Mia.

00:11:56.298 --> 00:11:59.176
But I think you should have
your own personal security from now on.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.512
Huh? Boss V, are you sure?

00:12:01.595 --> 00:12:05.182
Security? Miss Mia is
already so allergic to the two of us,

00:12:05.599 --> 00:12:09.353
and now you're going to hire big,
muscular guys she doesn't even know.

00:12:11.772 --> 00:12:13.232
I'll take care of it, Patrick.

00:12:13.983 --> 00:12:15.025
Do we have the budget?

00:12:15.109 --> 00:12:16.652
I'll take it from your salary.

00:12:17.111 --> 00:12:18.487
I'll handle it, okay?

00:12:19.071 --> 00:12:21.532
For Mia's safety, I'll do everything.

00:12:22.867 --> 00:12:24.118
Okay.

00:12:24.201 --> 00:12:25.494
She said okay?

00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:26.871
First time she's agreed to something.

00:12:28.706 --> 00:12:31.625
You're okay with that?
Someone watching you the whole day?

00:12:33.002 --> 00:12:34.503
Are you jealous?

00:12:36.255 --> 00:12:38.048
I agree with Vincent.

00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:40.551
You really should
have someone guarding you.

00:12:42.052 --> 00:12:43.554
Like I said,

00:12:43.637 --> 00:12:44.847
it's okay.

00:12:45.473 --> 00:12:48.184
I just don't want
to feel like I'm in a cage.

00:12:49.101 --> 00:12:51.437
I don't want any of this to stop me,

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:53.898
to stop all of us from living our lives.

00:12:56.025 --> 00:12:58.027
I feel like there's some twist coming--

00:12:58.110 --> 00:12:59.528
And because of that,

00:12:59.612 --> 00:13:02.656
I want to invite all of you to celebrate.

00:13:03.073 --> 00:13:04.325
Because finally,

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:07.578
my beautiful book with Matmat is finished.

00:13:09.205 --> 00:13:12.249
Yes, yes, yes!

00:13:12.333 --> 00:13:14.084
-Yes!
-Yay!

00:13:22.593 --> 00:13:23.969
Let's celebrate.

00:13:27.431 --> 00:13:29.850
Please go in,
someone will welcome you inside.

00:13:30.726 --> 00:13:32.061
Has security at the back been checked?

00:13:32.144 --> 00:13:33.812
-Yes, all good.
-Placed one already?

00:13:33.896 --> 00:13:35.940
-What about the one in front?
-Yes, it's all done.

00:13:36.315 --> 00:13:37.566
Okay, just follow him.

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:39.318
-Good morning.
-Hello, I'm Jason.

00:13:39.401 --> 00:13:40.569
This way.

00:13:40.653 --> 00:13:42.488
-Do you see that--
-Okay, okay!

00:13:42.571 --> 00:13:44.323
Everything should be perfect!

00:13:44.406 --> 00:13:46.992
Even if it's just us,
it still has to be elegant.

00:13:47.076 --> 00:13:48.327
We know Mia.

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:51.413
It should match
the aesthetics of our writer, okay?

00:13:52.206 --> 00:13:53.415
Patrick!

00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:55.251
Good thing
you dressed like that, very good!

00:13:55.334 --> 00:13:56.377
Very good!

00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:57.419
Huh, why?

00:13:57.503 --> 00:14:01.423
Because from years of
attending and socializing,

00:14:01.507 --> 00:14:04.510
I learned there should only be
one handsome guy at each event and…

00:14:06.845 --> 00:14:08.264
…today that's me.

00:14:10.015 --> 00:14:11.267
Hey.

00:14:11.934 --> 00:14:13.018
Hey, hey!

00:14:13.102 --> 00:14:15.104
There's Gemma, there they are!

00:14:15.187 --> 00:14:17.648
-That's them?
-Yes, that's them.

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:19.525
Very good.

00:14:19.859 --> 00:14:22.862
As the only handsome
guy at this event, move aside.

00:14:22.945 --> 00:14:24.822
I'll welcome the guests. Move, move.

00:14:24.905 --> 00:14:26.699
-Wow.
-Move, move, Patrick, move.

00:14:26.782 --> 00:14:28.450
-Stand here.
-Wow, Boss V.

00:14:30.911 --> 00:14:32.121
Hi!

00:14:32.204 --> 00:14:33.205
Welcome!

00:14:35.583 --> 00:14:37.167
Wel--

00:14:40.588 --> 00:14:43.007
G-Gemma.

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:44.425
-Hello!
-Hi, Miss Li!

00:14:44.508 --> 00:14:46.844
-Hi!
-You're so beautiful.

00:14:46.927 --> 00:14:49.471
-Gemma looks gorgeous.
-Miss Li, please come in.

00:14:49.555 --> 00:14:51.098
Doc, let's go.

00:14:52.057 --> 00:14:54.351
Of course, of course.

00:14:54.435 --> 00:14:58.230
All eyes on the pretty one again, right?

00:14:59.398 --> 00:15:01.609
Miss Li, I know you're already beautiful,

00:15:01.692 --> 00:15:03.861
but wow,
you look even more stunning today.

00:15:03.944 --> 00:15:05.487
Oh, Vincent.

00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:07.990
-Handsome as always.
-Thank you!

00:15:08.073 --> 00:15:09.575
So, shall we?

00:15:13.245 --> 00:15:15.080
Handsome? What about me?

00:15:15.164 --> 00:15:18.250
Let the younger
ones take the spotlight.

00:15:18.334 --> 00:15:19.627
Shall we?

00:15:20.878 --> 00:15:22.421
Come on, move.

00:15:23.005 --> 00:15:26.675
You'll get blown by the ill wind
and lose your game.

00:15:30.763 --> 00:15:32.139
Hey!

00:15:44.318 --> 00:15:46.654
Are you okay?
Do you need ice, are you hurt?

00:15:46.737 --> 00:15:48.739
-What do you need?
-I'm fine.

00:15:48.822 --> 00:15:51.283
Oh, hello!

00:15:51.367 --> 00:15:53.202
-Oh!
-Matmat!

00:15:53.285 --> 00:15:55.496
Hi, Gemma!

00:15:55.579 --> 00:15:58.123
-Mama Li!
-Matmat!

00:15:58.207 --> 00:15:59.708
Hi, Doc!

00:16:00.834 --> 00:16:02.753
-Hi, Doc.
-Welcome!

00:16:02.836 --> 00:16:05.339
Please get our guests a drink.

00:16:06.215 --> 00:16:08.801
We have snacks over here.
Welcome to Mia's home.

00:16:08.884 --> 00:16:11.512
Wow! Mia has such a big house.

00:16:11.595 --> 00:16:13.472
M-Mama Li, let's eat.

00:16:13.555 --> 00:16:15.349
-Oh, okay.
-Great, I'm hungry.

00:16:15.432 --> 00:16:17.184
Watch your blood sugar.

00:16:17.726 --> 00:16:20.187
-Go ahead.
-Alright, later.

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:23.524
-Madeth, drinks.
-Later, thanks.

00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:27.361
Here comes Mia.

00:16:27.444 --> 00:16:29.154
Oh, hi, Miss Mia!

00:16:29.822 --> 00:16:31.740
Yay!

00:16:32.866 --> 00:16:35.619
Yay!

00:16:43.669 --> 00:16:45.462
Welcome, everyone.

00:16:47.214 --> 00:16:50.259
I want you all to enjoy today.

00:16:51.051 --> 00:16:55.389
It's time to celebrate our new book,

00:16:55.472 --> 00:16:56.890
the one I made with Matmat.

00:16:58.934 --> 00:17:00.769
Congrats, Matmat!

00:17:00.853 --> 00:17:02.938
Yes!

00:17:03.022 --> 00:17:05.315
Congrats, Matmat! Congrats, Miss Mia!

00:17:05.399 --> 00:17:08.318
Congrats! Say hi to our live-stream.

00:17:08.402 --> 00:17:09.903
-Madeth!
-Huh?

00:17:09.987 --> 00:17:12.197
Why are you live-streaming?
It's supposed to be an intimate lunch.

00:17:13.782 --> 00:17:18.746
Oh Boss V, see Miss Mia told me to.

00:17:20.497 --> 00:17:22.207
You want everyone to see this?

00:17:22.291 --> 00:17:23.584
Yes.

00:17:25.294 --> 00:17:27.629
Specifically Eden and Olivia.

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:32.593
I want them to see
what they're doing doesn't affect my life.

00:17:32.676 --> 00:17:34.803
Mia, life must go on--

00:17:34.887 --> 00:17:36.430
I want them to come out.

00:17:37.181 --> 00:17:40.225
So I can find out
which one of them is my mother.

00:17:41.894 --> 00:17:44.229
Madeth, continue.

00:17:44.313 --> 00:17:45.731
Yes Miss Mia, one moment.

00:17:45.814 --> 00:17:47.524
Yes.

00:17:48.067 --> 00:17:50.903
Everyone, let's eat!

00:17:51.695 --> 00:17:53.322
Come on, folks.

00:17:53.405 --> 00:17:55.157
Let's go. Matmat.

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:58.452
Patrick, let's go.

00:17:59.787 --> 00:18:00.913
-Come on.
-Let's go.

00:18:00.996 --> 00:18:03.290
-Let's eat.
-Go ahead.

00:18:03.999 --> 00:18:05.000
Go on.

00:18:08.545 --> 00:18:10.255
-Be careful.
-Alright.

00:18:10.339 --> 00:18:11.423
Yes.

00:18:11.507 --> 00:18:13.801
Go on, boss. Hi!

00:18:13.884 --> 00:18:14.760
It's nice here.

00:18:16.637 --> 00:18:18.514
Have a seat, Matmat.

00:18:21.683 --> 00:18:24.019
M-Mama Li,
let's sit next to each other.

00:18:24.478 --> 00:18:25.604
Go ahead.

00:18:26.271 --> 00:18:29.108
Go ahead, have a seat.

00:18:29.483 --> 00:18:33.487
Here are our VIPs!

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:35.739
There they are!

00:18:35.823 --> 00:18:39.326
And of course, here is our writer,

00:18:39.409 --> 00:18:42.204
Miss Mia Hernandez!

00:18:42.287 --> 00:18:45.457
Here is her new illustrator

00:18:45.541 --> 00:18:50.003
for her new book, Mr. Matthew Gonzales!

00:18:51.421 --> 00:18:54.049
Congrats! Say hi!

00:18:57.511 --> 00:19:00.180
Hi, everyone! Thanks for watching.

00:19:00.264 --> 00:19:04.768
Continue to tune in as
we celebrate the book of Matmat's and I.

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:06.478
Yay!

00:19:06.562 --> 00:19:07.354
Yes!

00:19:07.437 --> 00:19:10.107
Okay.

00:19:10.899 --> 00:19:13.277
-Congratulations!
-Congrats!

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:15.946
Alright. Yes.

00:19:17.364 --> 00:19:19.283
Whoo…

00:19:19.366 --> 00:19:20.325
Yay!

00:19:20.409 --> 00:19:21.535
Thank you, thank you.

00:19:21.618 --> 00:19:22.494
There.

00:19:28.876 --> 00:19:30.294
Would you like to dance?

00:19:31.837 --> 00:19:35.841
I'd love to,
but I have no one to dance with.

00:19:38.969 --> 00:19:39.928
Dance with me.

00:19:40.012 --> 00:19:41.722
-Eat that up first.
-What?

00:19:41.805 --> 00:19:43.307
-Come on!
-Okay, okay.

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:46.185
-Right here.
-We can still dance!

00:19:46.268 --> 00:19:48.896
Of course. I exercise regularly.

00:19:48.979 --> 00:19:51.481
Well in fairness,
only if your knees can keep up.

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:57.779
So, why are you exercising regularly?

00:19:57.863 --> 00:19:59.656
Getting in shape for something?

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:01.617
For our future.

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:03.994
What do you mean "our" future?

00:20:04.077 --> 00:20:07.456
Because I want
to spend my retirement with you.

00:20:07.998 --> 00:20:09.875
I'll get straight to the point, Li,

00:20:09.958 --> 00:20:12.002
I'll be retiring next year.

00:20:12.085 --> 00:20:15.297
So you must retire as
the hospital cook as well.

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:19.134
And why do you seem
so sure I'll agree to that?

00:20:19.218 --> 00:20:22.221
I know you will
because I know you feel the same.

00:20:22.304 --> 00:20:24.598
-No!
-Am I wrong?

00:20:24.681 --> 00:20:27.309
Whatever! You're so silly!

00:20:27.392 --> 00:20:30.437
What are you talking about?
It seems serious.

00:20:30.896 --> 00:20:33.023
I'm serious about your mother, Gemma.

00:20:33.106 --> 00:20:35.734
This
turkey doesn't believe you.

00:20:35.817 --> 00:20:37.819
-My goodness.
-Listen, Doc Anok.

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:41.281
How about you dance
with your future daughter-in-law,

00:20:41.365 --> 00:20:44.201
while I dance with
my future mother-in-law?

00:20:44.284 --> 00:20:47.454
Wait a minute! When did we discuss that?

00:20:47.537 --> 00:20:48.580
In my dreams.

00:20:48.664 --> 00:20:51.083
-Come on, Mama Li.
-Oh…

00:20:51.166 --> 00:20:52.626
Come on, let's dance.

00:20:52.709 --> 00:20:54.127
What dance do we do?

00:20:54.211 --> 00:20:55.712
-Um…
-Hip-hop?

00:20:58.632 --> 00:21:01.051
It's so nice to see everyone happy.

00:21:01.134 --> 00:21:04.263
Mm-hmm…

00:21:04.346 --> 00:21:05.347
They're so happy.

00:21:07.933 --> 00:21:09.393
Want to dance, Matmat?

00:21:10.727 --> 00:21:14.273
W-Who will dance with Matmat?

00:21:16.817 --> 00:21:17.734
Me.

00:21:17.818 --> 00:21:20.821
Matmat and Patpat will dance?

00:21:20.904 --> 00:21:21.905
Mm-hmm.

00:21:22.698 --> 00:21:24.825
With Mia?

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:27.411
Me?

00:21:30.205 --> 00:21:32.165
We're family, right?

00:21:32.958 --> 00:21:35.585
Matmat is going to dance!

00:21:42.759 --> 00:21:44.261
Dance!

00:21:44.344 --> 00:21:45.887
Yay!

00:21:45.971 --> 00:21:49.182
Dance, Matmat!

00:21:49.266 --> 00:21:51.435
-Go, Matmat!
-Move it!

00:22:02.112 --> 00:22:04.031
How can we top that?

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:09.536
That’s an unbreakable kind of love.

00:22:10.412 --> 00:22:11.496
Go, Matmat.

00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:54.873
Mia, we're just going
to get something to drink.

00:22:56.083 --> 00:22:57.584
Excuse me.

00:22:58.126 --> 00:22:59.586
Are you happy, Matmat?

00:22:59.669 --> 00:23:01.671
M-Matmat is happy.

00:23:01.755 --> 00:23:04.800
There are so many happy people.

00:23:05.926 --> 00:23:09.346
We're all happy because
your book with Mia is done.

00:23:09.805 --> 00:23:11.973
Happy day!

00:23:12.057 --> 00:23:13.266
Happy day!

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:14.351
Here.

00:23:15.102 --> 00:23:16.978
Matmat wants to rest.

00:23:17.062 --> 00:23:18.271
Okay, sit down.

00:23:35.872 --> 00:23:37.207
-Bro.
-Hmm?

00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:38.500
Where's Mia?

00:23:39.042 --> 00:23:40.669
I don't know.
She's around here somewhere.

00:23:40.752 --> 00:23:42.796
-Huh? Where?
-Somewhere.

00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:54.391
Mia!

00:24:02.607 --> 00:24:03.650
Mia!

00:24:06.278 --> 00:24:07.779
Vincent, give me your keys.

00:24:08.613 --> 00:24:10.699
-Mia needs help.
-Bro? What happened?

00:24:11.241 --> 00:24:12.200
Bro!

00:24:15.245 --> 00:24:16.621
What happened?

00:24:24.671 --> 00:24:26.173
Why did you let Mia leave?

00:24:26.256 --> 00:24:28.967
-We couldn't stop her.
-Where is she going?

00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:30.385
She didn't say where.

00:24:30.468 --> 00:24:32.053
She just drove off.

00:24:32.137 --> 00:24:34.181
I'll go after her. Open the gate!

00:24:35.098 --> 00:24:36.308
Open the gate!

00:24:36.391 --> 00:24:37.475
Open it! Hurry!

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.450
Go wherever you'll be happy.

00:25:35.533 --> 00:25:38.787
Matmat loves his family.

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:42.582
"They have no faces
because the witch took them."

00:25:42.666 --> 00:25:44.167
I'm waiting for her return.

00:25:44.251 --> 00:25:46.920
I want to get justice
for my mother's death.

00:25:47.003 --> 00:25:49.214
She changed
her face to hide her true identity.

00:25:49.297 --> 00:25:51.925
Now that she's here,
she will hurt you too.

00:25:52.008 --> 00:25:53.802
She's alone. I'll take care of her.
