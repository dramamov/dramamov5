00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.880
Sir, he has no choice

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.160
but to choose me.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.440
I've swallowed my pride

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.770
and endured hardships.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.000
I've waited for so long.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.730
I've been waiting for this day.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.760
So you've been scheming all along

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.680
just for your own ambition.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.680
You kept saying it was all for me,

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.600
but those were all lies.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.200
Who says it's not true?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.920
Don't forget,

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.600
what you had with Liu Silin was just a fling,

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.260
but you and I grew up together.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.280
I order you

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.680
to leave him immediately.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.200
We'll be

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.600
taking our leave now.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:17.720
Thank you.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.039
Please.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:27.400
Caiyue.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.360
Where is the young mistress?

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.200
She was just here.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.200
Where did she go?

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.240
What about me?

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.759
What am I to you?

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.039
You tell me to leave and I leave.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.240
You tell me to stay and I stay.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.039
Am I just a pawn to you?

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.520
Or a puppet you can summon and dismiss at will?

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.360
Don't forget.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.039
He was the one who took me away from you.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.660
Now I want to take you back.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.720
I want to take you back.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.570
I order you to leave him.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.500
Did you hear me?

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.960
Let go of me.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.280
Silin.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.680
Let me go.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.160
Silin.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.560
Are you okay?

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.020
What are you doing?

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.720
Liu Silin.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.880
Don't think you can compete with me just because you dug up some old recipes.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:22.960
Just you wait.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.960
I don't believe that shabby restaurant of yours can stay in business.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.200
We'll see about that.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.840
Liu Silin.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.620
I really underestimated you.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.600
I should have known your madness was all an act.

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:37.880
Pretending for all these years.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.160
It must have been hard on you.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.240
You can only blame your own poor judgment.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.640
Let me warn you too.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.880
If you dare touch Yiyu again,

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.160
that head on your shoulders,

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.520
I'll take it off myself.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:57.760
Let's go.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.880
I'll take you somewhere.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:13.760
Where?

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.160
This is your mother's memorial tablet.

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.399
On my 18th birthday,

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.260
my mother committed suicide.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.480
It's snowing.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.480
On my 18th birthday,

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.810
it was a snowy night just like this.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.200
Today is my son Silin's birthday.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.760
Thank you all for coming.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.920
Have a drink.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.200
Thank you.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:12.480
Come.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.240
Mother.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.090
Good. Please be seated, everyone.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.200
Sir, the item you requested.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.360
Silin,

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.680
this is from your mother and me,

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.320
a birthday gift for you.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.480
Thank you, Father.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.010
You should thank your mother for raising you.

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.140
Thank you, Mother.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.960
Father.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.200
Do you like it?

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.080
I do.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.200
Good.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.920
Mother.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.080
Mother.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:28.400
Mother.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.480
Mother.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.200
Mother.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.360
I'm convinced my mother's death wasn't so simple.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.420
She and my father were deeply in love.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:51.860
And it was my birthday.

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.170
Why would she take her own life?

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.159
Mother.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.080
Mother.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.920
Please wake up.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.040
Yaqin.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.080
Yaqin.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.520
Yaqin.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.760
Why?

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.000
That wasn't something my parents brought.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:15.880
Well.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.440
Madam Liu

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.280
she and someone else.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.090
I never thought my mother would betray my father.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.160
I was completely distraught at that time.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.720
So was it from then on

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.880
that your temperament became violent?

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.200
So those servants were really killed by you?

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.200
I have never harmed anyone.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.159
After that day,

00:07:37.159 --> 00:07:40.280
servants began having accidents in my courtyard for no reason.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.480
People started spreading rumors

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.740
that I was born to kill.

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:43.920
and capable of any evil.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.180
This is already the third one this month.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.520
Ever since our young master went mad,

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.240
he's been torturing servants to death.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.159
Let's try to avoid him from now on.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:52.880
Yes.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.220
I couldn't defend myself.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:56.840
Gradually,

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.080
my father started believing these rumors too.

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.140
He grew more and more distant from me.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.080
No matter how I tried to explain,

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.200
it was all in vain.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.320
I lost my mother

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.730
and then lost my father's protection.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.610
I gradually became bullied in my own home.

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.300
Then why did you pretend to be mad?

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.400
Because of a big fire in my room three years ago.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:22.120
I could tell someone deliberately set the fire to kill me.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.480
I escaped by luck.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.280
Having survived this disaster,

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.520
I took the opportunity to pretend to be insane.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:28.720
To deceive my enemies

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:29.930
and protect myself.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.640
Do you believe me?

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.880
But once,

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.280
I saw you kill a servant with my own eyes.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.780
That person was trying to kill me.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.400
I discovered his plan.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:51.920
To protect myself,

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.850
I accidentally killed him.

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.200
So that's what happened.

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:19.520
I misunderstood you before.

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:22.680
But don't you care what others think of you?

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:24.360
I don't care.

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:28.480
Since they want me to be a murderous monster,

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:29.760
a madman,

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:32.600
I'll play along with their game until the end.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:34.840
And now I have you.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:36.960
As long as you believe in me

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.660
and understand me,

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.970
I'm not afraid of anything.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:48.640
Silin.

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.080
Yiyu.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.200
Your father was also at Fulu Restaurant

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.320
when the incident happened to my mother on the same day.

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.650
I'll definitely get to the bottom of this.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:04.520
Yes.

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.440
Young master, young mistress.

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.570
It's time to wash up.

00:12:58.280 --> 00:12:59.140
It's all right.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.900
Let her sleep a little longer.

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:25.000
Yu.
