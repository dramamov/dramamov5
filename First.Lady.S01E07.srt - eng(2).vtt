00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:44.961
CHILD AND ANIMAL WELFARE
REGULATIONS WERE OBSERVED

00:01:02.812 --> 00:01:03.646
Sis.

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:08.818
You came to see the paintings.

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:10.737
You're doing just fine.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.531
People would talk if they saw us together.

00:01:14.157 --> 00:01:15.867
It's quiet here at least.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.243
And…

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:21.289
we aren't related by blood,
so don't call me sister.

00:01:21.372 --> 00:01:22.665
Come on.

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:24.501
I'm just grateful.

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:26.711
It's thanks to you that I was released.

00:01:34.385 --> 00:01:37.472
Then we should settle the bill.

00:01:38.807 --> 00:01:40.975
I heard Hwa-jin was here.

00:01:43.436 --> 00:01:44.395
I'm not sure.

00:01:46.064 --> 00:01:47.982
Why did you call Choi Myeong-ju then?

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.445
"Lee Hwa-jin is here."
Didn't you need someone to tattle to me?

00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:57.325
I knew it.

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.162
You and I think alike.

00:02:01.246 --> 00:02:02.997
Why are you keeping her?

00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:05.667
Because I heard you were
desperately looking for her.

00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:07.085
From whom?

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.422
My brother-in-law
got Lee Hwa-jin discharged,

00:02:12.006 --> 00:02:14.259
and my sister was looking for her?

00:02:15.426 --> 00:02:16.594
Why?

00:02:16.678 --> 00:02:18.221
There must be a reason.

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:20.515
Where did the patient in Room 501 go?

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:24.602
I found that odd,

00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:28.773
and the doctor who saw
her blood test result reacted strangely.

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:30.942
Is this accurate?

00:02:31.442 --> 00:02:33.945
So I checked the blood test result again.

00:02:34.571 --> 00:02:35.655
I found it strange too.

00:02:37.532 --> 00:02:39.367
Why? What was strange?

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.286
Check the blood test result.

00:02:44.122 --> 00:02:45.290
Here.

00:02:47.584 --> 00:02:48.751
Lee Hwa-jin

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:51.337
is likely pregnant.

00:02:58.303 --> 00:02:59.304
Pregnant?

00:02:59.387 --> 00:03:00.680
About Hwa-jin.

00:03:01.347 --> 00:03:03.850
At first glance, I thought,
"What the heck?"

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:07.604
But after getting her cleaned
and dolled up,

00:03:09.105 --> 00:03:11.900
she was a sight to behold.

00:03:12.984 --> 00:03:14.152
My brother-in-law

00:03:14.736 --> 00:03:16.154
has an eye for women.

00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:20.742
Is the baby…

00:03:21.326 --> 00:03:22.368
It's his child?

00:03:22.994 --> 00:03:24.871
You know I hate spoilers.

00:03:24.954 --> 00:03:26.372
Answer me.

00:03:27.916 --> 00:03:29.042
Well…

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.503
Go and ask her yourself.

00:03:33.171 --> 00:03:34.380
She's waiting for you.

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:39.928
You know what, Sis?

00:03:40.011 --> 00:03:41.763
Two hundred and sixty-six days.

00:03:41.846 --> 00:03:46.100
They say it takes a whole 266 days
from getting pregnant to giving birth.

00:03:46.184 --> 00:03:49.312
That's 6,384 hours.

00:03:49.395 --> 00:03:51.397
I'm good at math, you know.

00:03:52.023 --> 00:03:53.650
That's a long time.

00:03:55.193 --> 00:03:57.278
What are you doing? Come on.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.330
I never understood

00:04:07.872 --> 00:04:10.250
why you and Min-cheol kept going on

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:12.460
about how one person had to change

00:04:12.543 --> 00:04:14.212
or be saved.

00:04:14.295 --> 00:04:15.672
Then I learned

00:04:15.755 --> 00:04:17.840
that it takes 266 days.

00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:20.593
It takes 6,384 hours.

00:04:21.344 --> 00:04:24.889
Now I get
why you said one person is one world.

00:04:24.973 --> 00:04:27.475
It makes sense.

00:04:28.226 --> 00:04:29.269
I get it now.

00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:54.168
Two ahead. You go first.

00:04:54.252 --> 00:04:55.503
-I'm going in.
-Go.

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:07.724
Seon U-yeong!

00:05:09.267 --> 00:05:10.476
Seon U-yeong!

00:05:11.102 --> 00:05:12.061
Seon U-yeong!

00:05:13.646 --> 00:05:14.605
Seon U-yeong!

00:05:16.232 --> 00:05:17.608
-Stop there, you punk!
-Hey!

00:05:17.692 --> 00:05:18.943
What's going on?

00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:21.571
Darn it.

00:05:22.697 --> 00:05:23.781
Stop there!

00:05:24.407 --> 00:05:25.325
Move!

00:05:29.746 --> 00:05:30.663
Stay still.

00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:34.334
Hey, get off of me.

00:05:34.417 --> 00:05:36.419
Seon U-yeong,
you're under arrest for theft.

00:05:36.502 --> 00:05:39.213
You have the right to an attorney,
and to remain silent.

00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:42.508
I didn't do anything.
I don't know anything.

00:05:43.593 --> 00:05:44.594
Get up.

00:05:45.261 --> 00:05:46.888
Oh, for goodness' sake.

00:05:48.222 --> 00:05:49.807
-U-yeong.
-It's not what you think.

00:05:49.891 --> 00:05:51.142
Something went wrong.

00:05:51.225 --> 00:05:53.519
-U-yeong.
-I'm not guilty. Don't worry.

00:05:53.603 --> 00:05:56.189
Why are you doing this?
What did U-yeong do?

00:05:56.272 --> 00:05:58.357
We can talk in Haseong Police Station.

00:05:58.441 --> 00:06:00.026
Sir!

00:06:00.109 --> 00:06:02.278
This can be considered
obstruction of justice.

00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:03.654
Su-mi, wait at home.

00:06:03.738 --> 00:06:06.032
I'll clear up the misunderstanding
and go home.

00:06:06.115 --> 00:06:07.325
-Let's go, Detective.
-Move.

00:06:07.408 --> 00:06:09.327
U-yeong.

00:06:18.377 --> 00:06:20.088
Let go!

00:06:20.171 --> 00:06:22.131
You need the chairman's approval.

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:23.549
I said I'd be right back.

00:06:23.633 --> 00:06:24.842
No, you can't!

00:06:27.929 --> 00:06:29.013
Is it this dress?

00:06:29.764 --> 00:06:31.349
Because of this darn dress?

00:06:32.016 --> 00:06:34.018
I'll take it off and go then.

00:06:34.102 --> 00:06:35.394
Geez.

00:06:42.026 --> 00:06:42.860
Hi, Su-mi.

00:06:42.944 --> 00:06:44.946
U-yeong is
in Haseong Police Station, right?

00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:46.114
I'll be right there.

00:06:46.197 --> 00:06:47.281
Stop her.

00:06:48.825 --> 00:06:50.368
-Move.
-No, ma'am.

00:06:50.451 --> 00:06:51.494
I said, move.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.247
Hey, stop her.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.332
I said I'd be right back!

00:06:56.415 --> 00:06:58.292
Let go of me!

00:06:58.376 --> 00:07:00.753
Let go!

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:03.339
What…

00:07:03.422 --> 00:07:05.258
What's going on?

00:07:05.925 --> 00:07:07.009
What…

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:09.470
Hey. Hey!

00:07:10.638 --> 00:07:11.681
What the…

00:07:12.473 --> 00:07:14.267
God damn it.

00:07:15.309 --> 00:07:17.728
Hey.

00:07:17.812 --> 00:07:18.855
Hey.

00:07:23.151 --> 00:07:25.486
What happened to her?

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.156
We didn't do anything.

00:07:28.239 --> 00:07:30.408
She wanted to go out,
so we tried to stop her,

00:07:30.491 --> 00:07:32.076
and she suddenly passed out.

00:07:33.369 --> 00:07:35.288
Sis, what do we do?

00:07:48.634 --> 00:07:49.552
Sis.

00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:51.095
Is she dead?

00:07:55.057 --> 00:07:56.058
Is she alive?

00:08:37.975 --> 00:08:39.602
What are you doing?

00:08:39.685 --> 00:08:40.937
Just stay.

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:45.024
Ma'am.

00:08:53.074 --> 00:08:54.992
The doctor said you needed to rest.

00:08:55.076 --> 00:08:56.118
So lie down.

00:08:57.495 --> 00:08:59.789
I need to go. Someone's waiting for me.

00:08:59.872 --> 00:09:01.415
It's for the baby too.

00:09:03.793 --> 00:09:05.503
I heard you're pregnant.

00:09:11.092 --> 00:09:12.385
How do you

00:09:13.511 --> 00:09:15.429
know that?

00:09:23.938 --> 00:09:25.106
I said, lie down.

00:09:27.942 --> 00:09:29.819
Ma'am, I need your help.

00:09:29.902 --> 00:09:32.613
Please get U-yeong out
of the police station.

00:09:32.697 --> 00:09:34.574
He didn't do anything wrong.

00:09:34.657 --> 00:09:38.119
Please tell them that the necklace was
just a present for me.

00:09:43.124 --> 00:09:44.125
Necklace?

00:09:46.961 --> 00:09:48.754
I'm doomed.

00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:52.758
I'm doomed now. What do I do?

00:09:52.842 --> 00:09:55.678
Is Su-mi really doomed?

00:09:56.804 --> 00:09:58.973
I saw this coming
when she was going overboard.

00:10:00.182 --> 00:10:02.810
U-yeong, what do I do?

00:10:04.395 --> 00:10:06.606
Could you sell this for me?

00:10:10.776 --> 00:10:12.236
Where did you get this?

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:16.240
-Did you…
-Don't ask anything.

00:10:16.324 --> 00:10:18.284
Just take care of it quietly.

00:10:21.412 --> 00:10:22.455
Okay.

00:10:26.083 --> 00:10:28.044
But how much should I charge for this?

00:10:28.127 --> 00:10:30.880
Just enough to get back what Su-mi lost.

00:10:32.089 --> 00:10:35.426
Right. There's this guy
I got to know in juvie.

00:10:35.926 --> 00:10:38.596
He's an expert in this area. I'll ask him.

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:44.477
I'm sorry.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:45.478
For what?

00:10:46.896 --> 00:10:48.314
It was my fault

00:10:48.397 --> 00:10:50.024
that you went to juvie.

00:10:53.152 --> 00:10:54.570
It was thanks to you.

00:10:57.073 --> 00:10:59.575
I got to be in a place like that
thanks to you.

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:01.327
If I hadn't met you,

00:11:02.119 --> 00:11:04.205
my life would've been so boring.

00:11:07.416 --> 00:11:09.085
So Ji-yu was right.

00:11:10.711 --> 00:11:12.171
Ji-yu told me that

00:11:12.254 --> 00:11:15.174
you must've stolen the necklace.

00:11:16.258 --> 00:11:20.429
She said she saw you search our closet
with the lights off on the election day.

00:11:21.472 --> 00:11:22.348
That's not true.

00:11:23.724 --> 00:11:26.977
I did steal the necklace,
but not on that day.

00:11:27.061 --> 00:11:28.646
Then when did you steal it?

00:11:28.729 --> 00:11:30.356
And why did you steal it?

00:11:30.439 --> 00:11:32.191
Why that necklace of all things?

00:11:34.318 --> 00:11:37.446
Because I saw you and Ji-yu
talk about the necklace.

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.323
I figured it'd be expensive.

00:11:39.407 --> 00:11:41.700
I didn't plan to steal it, though.

00:11:42.451 --> 00:11:43.494
I just…

00:11:47.248 --> 00:11:50.459
I just wanted to try it on once.

00:11:51.335 --> 00:11:53.337
Just like Ji-yu did.

00:11:54.964 --> 00:11:57.174
I just wanted to try it on once.

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:05.724
FEBRUARY 8, 2027

00:12:11.689 --> 00:12:13.566
-When you turn 20?
-Yes.

00:12:14.358 --> 00:12:16.694
No, that's insane.

00:12:16.777 --> 00:12:18.320
You turning 20?

00:12:18.404 --> 00:12:20.656
Come on. Three years will fly by.

00:12:20.739 --> 00:12:23.284
So please keep it safe until then.

00:12:23.909 --> 00:12:25.035
Okay.

00:12:25.119 --> 00:12:27.246
Then I'll keep it well until then.

00:12:27.329 --> 00:12:29.081
Oh, wait.

00:12:29.165 --> 00:12:30.833
Let me see it once again.

00:12:33.002 --> 00:12:34.003
Here.

00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:36.380
It looks great on you.

00:12:38.007 --> 00:12:40.259
Congratulations on starting high school.

00:12:40.342 --> 00:12:41.635
Thank you.

00:13:56.835 --> 00:13:58.546
Yes, I just got home.

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:01.882
I forgot about the dress code.

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:04.051
I'll just grab my tie real quick.

00:14:04.134 --> 00:14:05.928
Then Mr. Hyun suddenly came in.

00:14:06.595 --> 00:14:08.973
I panicked and then passed out.

00:14:09.056 --> 00:14:10.474
Just like today.

00:14:12.101 --> 00:14:13.686
Like today?

00:14:14.353 --> 00:14:16.772
Yes, just like today.

00:14:16.855 --> 00:14:17.856
Hwa-jin.

00:14:20.234 --> 00:14:21.360
Are you okay?

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.448
But I couldn't answer.

00:14:26.532 --> 00:14:27.908
Because I passed out again.

00:14:27.992 --> 00:14:28.868
Hwa-jin.

00:14:28.951 --> 00:14:31.954
It doesn't happen a lot,
but it happens sometimes.

00:14:32.037 --> 00:14:33.414
You know when you're half-asleep

00:14:33.497 --> 00:14:36.375
and you just can't wake up
no matter how hard you try?

00:14:36.458 --> 00:14:37.459
That's what it felt like.

00:14:37.543 --> 00:14:38.544
Hwa-jin.

00:14:39.169 --> 00:14:40.170
Hwa-jin.

00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:56.729
I saw what you two did.

00:14:56.812 --> 00:14:59.148
-It's not what you think.
-What are you talking about?

00:14:59.231 --> 00:15:01.108
It's nothing like what you think.

00:15:01.191 --> 00:15:04.778
There was an accident like today,
and I was worried about her--

00:15:04.862 --> 00:15:07.364
I said I saw everything!

00:15:07.948 --> 00:15:09.366
I saw it.

00:15:10.034 --> 00:15:12.077
Then Ji-yu must've seen that

00:15:12.703 --> 00:15:14.538
and misunderstood.

00:15:14.622 --> 00:15:17.291
Misunderstood? Misunderstood what?

00:15:18.417 --> 00:15:19.501
Never mind.

00:15:23.797 --> 00:15:27.259
So he came in
when you were trying the necklace on,

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:31.597
and then you passed out?

00:15:32.431 --> 00:15:33.515
Yes.

00:15:33.599 --> 00:15:35.309
And then?

00:15:36.352 --> 00:15:37.770
What happened next?

00:16:00.542 --> 00:16:01.752
Hwa-jin, are you okay?

00:16:11.512 --> 00:16:12.763
Sir.

00:16:13.347 --> 00:16:15.057
Can you stand up?

00:16:18.852 --> 00:16:19.853
Yes.

00:16:19.937 --> 00:16:21.772
I didn't steal it.

00:16:21.855 --> 00:16:25.526
I thought he wouldn't believe me
if I explained why I was wearing it.

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:30.531
So I thought I would just take it
and put it back later.

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:35.369
-Let me take you to the hospital.
-No, I'm okay.

00:16:39.248 --> 00:16:40.499
I'm really okay.

00:16:40.582 --> 00:16:43.502
This happens every now and then.

00:16:44.294 --> 00:16:46.839
The doctor said it's okay too.

00:16:46.922 --> 00:16:47.965
It's called

00:16:48.507 --> 00:16:51.927
vasovagal something.

00:16:52.011 --> 00:16:55.848
It sounds like a serious illness,
but it's just fainting.

00:16:59.101 --> 00:17:00.310
Are you sure you're okay?

00:17:01.729 --> 00:17:03.272
I'm totally fine now.

00:17:08.444 --> 00:17:11.113
That's why I went back
to the walk-in closet

00:17:11.196 --> 00:17:13.323
saying that I'd left my phone there.

00:17:13.407 --> 00:17:16.285
It was to put the necklace back.

00:17:16.368 --> 00:17:17.369
It's true.

00:17:18.412 --> 00:17:19.955
Do you expect me to believe that?

00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:22.124
It's true. Please believe me.

00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:26.462
You told Ji-yu
it was to find the pendant you'd lost.

00:17:26.545 --> 00:17:27.546
That was

00:17:28.422 --> 00:17:30.257
just an excuse.

00:17:31.258 --> 00:17:34.803
You asked her to give the pendant back,
and Ji-yu refused to.

00:17:34.887 --> 00:17:38.932
Then you tried to take it from her,
which led to the accident.

00:17:47.399 --> 00:17:50.027
Then what did you and he talk about
at the parking lot

00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:51.570
when you got the pendant back?

00:17:52.738 --> 00:17:53.655
Parking lot?

00:17:53.739 --> 00:17:57.451
He gave you the pendant back
at the parking lot.

00:18:00.204 --> 00:18:04.166
I got the pendant back
from Secretary Shin, not Mr. Hyun.

00:18:05.751 --> 00:18:07.961
What? Secretary Shin?

00:18:09.171 --> 00:18:10.172
Here.

00:18:11.256 --> 00:18:13.008
I forgot to give it back.

00:18:23.393 --> 00:18:25.187
He wants to give this back to you.

00:18:26.146 --> 00:18:27.147
Right.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:32.903
You want me to drive you home?

00:18:34.029 --> 00:18:36.698
Yes, I just want to get changed first.

00:18:38.575 --> 00:18:39.535
What's the address?

00:18:40.202 --> 00:18:41.578
It's close from here.

00:18:41.662 --> 00:18:45.082
Building A, Urban Tree,
82 Gyojeong-ro, Haseong.

00:19:00.806 --> 00:19:03.725
So it was Secretary Shin
that he handed the pendant to.

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:06.270
I misunderstood.

00:19:07.146 --> 00:19:08.856
I thought it was you.

00:19:11.024 --> 00:19:11.859
Pardon?

00:19:12.985 --> 00:19:15.654
So you asked your friend
to sell the necklace?

00:19:16.905 --> 00:19:17.948
I'm sorry.

00:19:18.031 --> 00:19:20.117
I urgently needed money.

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:23.370
And you're asking me
to help to release the friend

00:19:23.453 --> 00:19:25.289
who got arrested for selling it.

00:19:25.372 --> 00:19:28.709
Yes, just saying that it was a gift
would do.

00:19:35.215 --> 00:19:36.133
Why should I?

00:19:36.925 --> 00:19:40.596
Why should I lie just to help you?

00:19:42.681 --> 00:19:45.058
I'll do anything I can
to return your favor.

00:19:45.142 --> 00:19:46.810
How?

00:19:46.894 --> 00:19:47.936
With money?

00:19:48.645 --> 00:19:49.646
Do you have money?

00:19:51.231 --> 00:19:54.151
Not at the moment,
but I'll pay you back somehow.

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:02.159
I'll do whatever you say.

00:20:05.454 --> 00:20:06.371
Whatever?

00:20:06.455 --> 00:20:08.790
I'll do whatever you want me to do.

00:20:08.874 --> 00:20:09.875
So please…

00:20:11.168 --> 00:20:13.587
Please get U-yeong out.

00:20:20.093 --> 00:20:21.386
You're pregnant, right?

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:22.804
Yes.

00:20:29.937 --> 00:20:32.481
But what about it?

00:20:32.564 --> 00:20:33.774
Who's the father?

00:20:35.442 --> 00:20:38.237
Who's the father of the baby?

00:20:59.508 --> 00:21:02.219
I'm heading out first.
It's going to rain today.

00:21:02.803 --> 00:21:04.304
Don't forget your umbrella.

00:21:10.018 --> 00:21:13.188
It's the real Indian curry, your favorite.

00:21:13.272 --> 00:21:15.482
Don't order delivery food like last time.

00:21:15.565 --> 00:21:17.317
Microwave it for two minutes,

00:21:17.401 --> 00:21:20.612
take it out, stir it,
and then microwave it for one more minute.

00:21:20.696 --> 00:21:22.698
Then it'll heat evenly and taste better.

00:21:25.325 --> 00:21:26.827
Don't forget to eat these too.

00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:28.704
Or you're upsetting these guys.

00:21:37.254 --> 00:21:39.047
CHICKEN DELIVERY

00:21:44.511 --> 00:21:47.514
-You haven't eaten yet, right?
-No, I was going to.

00:21:48.098 --> 00:21:49.891
I was about to microwave the curry.

00:21:49.975 --> 00:21:51.643
No, don't eat that.

00:21:51.727 --> 00:21:52.894
Why not?

00:21:52.978 --> 00:21:55.564
Could you wait a little?
Let's eat together.

00:22:03.947 --> 00:22:04.781
Go wash up.

00:22:22.341 --> 00:22:23.759
Come on. Eat up.

00:22:23.842 --> 00:22:25.469
Is it someone's birthday today?

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:27.471
Birthday?

00:22:27.971 --> 00:22:28.805
Why?

00:22:36.021 --> 00:22:38.815
Don't you think this is a little too much?

00:22:40.192 --> 00:22:41.610
It's not too much.

00:22:42.402 --> 00:22:44.237
If only I weren't so busy,

00:22:44.321 --> 00:22:47.991
I could easily make a dozen side dishes.

00:22:48.075 --> 00:22:51.203
Even just now,
I put together a whole meal in no time.

00:22:53.789 --> 00:22:55.540
What do you think? Do you like it?

00:22:55.624 --> 00:22:56.792
Yes, it's tasty.

00:22:57.375 --> 00:22:59.753
But this is definitely too much.

00:22:59.836 --> 00:23:02.964
I mean, look at me.
I feel so lost at the table.

00:23:04.382 --> 00:23:06.968
Gang-myeong, you're so sweet.

00:23:08.428 --> 00:23:09.471
But

00:23:10.097 --> 00:23:11.473
make sure it's just for me.

00:23:11.556 --> 00:23:14.309
Don't be like that to other girls. Okay?

00:23:14.893 --> 00:23:17.062
-What are you saying?
-"What are you saying?"

00:23:17.145 --> 00:23:18.271
Don't do that.

00:23:19.189 --> 00:23:21.608
Fine. It's because it was so cute.

00:23:23.735 --> 00:23:27.864
Here. Have some mackerel. You like it.

00:23:27.948 --> 00:23:29.282
I was already eating it.

00:23:29.366 --> 00:23:31.159
Don't you see I'm getting chubby here?

00:23:35.497 --> 00:23:38.291
Your dad used to say that a lot.

00:23:39.501 --> 00:23:40.502
You remember it.

00:23:40.585 --> 00:23:41.837
Of course.

00:23:42.838 --> 00:23:44.422
Everything he said

00:23:44.923 --> 00:23:46.591
and every prank he played on me…

00:23:47.884 --> 00:23:50.137
I remember them all,
even though I was only seven.

00:23:54.057 --> 00:23:55.976
Remember me too, okay?

00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:58.478
What are you talking about?

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:01.898
I'm just jealous.

00:24:02.566 --> 00:24:06.069
I'll be jealous if you don't remember me
like you remember your dad.

00:24:08.029 --> 00:24:10.240
This won't do. You should have some beer.

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:14.161
-Can I?
-Alcohol is the best cure for jealousy.

00:24:15.453 --> 00:24:17.998
My boy is so smart.

00:24:18.081 --> 00:24:19.166
Give me one second.

00:24:46.985 --> 00:24:48.028
Thanks.

00:24:52.949 --> 00:24:54.201
AIDE LIM HYUN-GYO

00:24:55.911 --> 00:24:58.830
Hello? What is it at this hour?

00:24:59.831 --> 00:25:00.665
Work?

00:25:00.749 --> 00:25:01.833
Yes, it's work.

00:25:05.212 --> 00:25:06.796
I'm having dinner with my son.

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:09.174
Why don't we meet another time?

00:25:09.257 --> 00:25:11.885
Later, let's talk about it later.

00:25:20.101 --> 00:25:21.311
This is nice.

00:25:22.354 --> 00:25:24.314
Probably because my son poured it.

00:25:24.397 --> 00:25:26.316
Are you sure you don't need to go?

00:25:28.443 --> 00:25:31.488
The beer my son poured for me
tastes so good.

00:25:32.239 --> 00:25:35.325
It must be even better
if I drink with him.

00:25:36.243 --> 00:25:37.869
I can't wait.

00:25:37.953 --> 00:25:39.496
Didn't you say not to grow up fast?

00:25:44.542 --> 00:25:47.212
With all the nice things you've done,

00:25:47.879 --> 00:25:50.006
you've done your part as a son.

00:25:51.216 --> 00:25:54.594
So once you turn 20,

00:25:54.678 --> 00:25:58.014
drink beer, make a girlfriend…

00:25:58.723 --> 00:26:00.976
Do anything you want.

00:26:01.059 --> 00:26:03.228
You're so fickle.

00:26:05.981 --> 00:26:07.065
Oh, I forgot.

00:26:07.148 --> 00:26:10.110
I made japchae
and forgot to put it on the table.

00:26:10.193 --> 00:26:12.570
Give me one second. Keep eating.

00:26:22.956 --> 00:26:24.624
Mom, you got a text.

00:26:36.636 --> 00:26:39.848
I'm on my way to your place now.
It won't take long.

00:26:59.909 --> 00:27:01.453
Darn it.

00:27:05.206 --> 00:27:06.750
I've become

00:27:07.625 --> 00:27:09.502
so out of shape.

00:27:11.588 --> 00:27:14.549
I said later,
but you even came to my place.

00:27:14.632 --> 00:27:16.301
What's so urgent?

00:27:17.594 --> 00:27:18.678
I heard you quit.

00:27:19.971 --> 00:27:23.475
I thought we could grab a drink
since we're both left out.

00:27:24.351 --> 00:27:25.560
What do you mean?

00:27:27.312 --> 00:27:28.938
Cha Su-yeon totally

00:27:29.522 --> 00:27:31.149
stabbed me in the back.

00:27:32.942 --> 00:27:34.569
What are you talking about?

00:27:34.652 --> 00:27:35.904
I don't understand.

00:27:37.113 --> 00:27:38.782
She asked me

00:27:38.865 --> 00:27:41.701
to block the special act
and reverse our party's stance.

00:27:42.494 --> 00:27:44.996
So I took it upon myself.

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:47.874
Come on, don't look at me like that.

00:27:47.957 --> 00:27:50.710
All my life,
I've lived in the shadow of others.

00:27:50.794 --> 00:27:53.088
So I wanted to step
into the light for once.

00:27:53.171 --> 00:27:54.464
That's why.

00:27:59.803 --> 00:28:02.138
In exchange
for reversing the party's stance,

00:28:02.222 --> 00:28:03.598
what did she demand?

00:28:04.391 --> 00:28:06.309
If she did, I wouldn't be this upset.

00:28:08.478 --> 00:28:09.813
Well…

00:28:09.896 --> 00:28:12.982
At least I proved my influence
by reversing the party's stance.

00:28:13.066 --> 00:28:17.612
So I was thinking of using that
to get a few assemblymen elected

00:28:17.695 --> 00:28:19.280
in the general election.

00:28:19.364 --> 00:28:21.950
Then she backstabbed me,
using that as an excuse.

00:28:22.033 --> 00:28:23.618
Can you believe that?

00:28:23.701 --> 00:28:26.413
The next general election
and presidential election?

00:28:27.163 --> 00:28:29.082
You had too big a dream.

00:28:34.712 --> 00:28:36.840
Reflecting on it only upsets me more.

00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:38.550
I am

00:28:39.217 --> 00:28:40.385
going to

00:28:40.927 --> 00:28:42.011
return the favor.

00:28:44.806 --> 00:28:45.932
What's your plan?

00:28:50.145 --> 00:28:52.272
You came to talk to me,

00:28:52.355 --> 00:28:53.732
so you must have a plan.

00:29:05.243 --> 00:29:06.494
Cha Su-yeon

00:29:06.578 --> 00:29:09.706
has got dirt
on a lot of my party's assemblymen.

00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:12.292
She sort of inherited that
from his father.

00:29:13.084 --> 00:29:15.295
I just need to get hold of the ledger.

00:29:17.797 --> 00:29:19.966
What makes you think I'll help you?

00:29:20.049 --> 00:29:22.469
Come on. You got fired too.

00:29:22.552 --> 00:29:25.054
When you were
just about to join the Cabinet.

00:29:25.138 --> 00:29:28.933
There must be something you want
out of frustration.

00:29:31.186 --> 00:29:33.646
Why don't you join my party?

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:35.857
We can team up and start over.

00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:41.154
If we manage to convince
the assemblymen with the ledger,

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:42.864
can we get

00:29:43.782 --> 00:29:45.241
the special act passed?

00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:47.243
The Do Tae-hun Special Act?

00:29:49.454 --> 00:29:52.290
Can you reverse the party's stance again?

00:29:53.833 --> 00:29:54.876
Wait.

00:29:55.668 --> 00:29:57.295
You wanted the special act too?

00:29:58.546 --> 00:29:59.464
Why?

00:30:00.381 --> 00:30:02.717
Wasn't that what President-elect wanted?

00:30:03.259 --> 00:30:06.930
That's why I proposed to him
that I'd shift my party's stance for him.

00:30:07.013 --> 00:30:09.974
But he kept dragging his feet. Goodness.

00:30:13.812 --> 00:30:16.856
You proposed to him,
but he didn't accept it?

00:30:17.941 --> 00:30:20.193
That's why I've ended up like this.

00:30:20.276 --> 00:30:22.612
In a situation where every second matters,

00:30:22.695 --> 00:30:24.030
he took his time to think.

00:30:24.113 --> 00:30:26.533
That's how Cha Su-yeon got me good.
Darn it.

00:30:28.785 --> 00:30:31.955
You're saying President-elect
really didn't accept your offer.

00:30:32.038 --> 00:30:33.414
I'm telling you.

00:30:33.998 --> 00:30:37.627
He's terrible at seizing the right moment.

00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:39.212
He's helpless at that.

00:30:40.255 --> 00:30:42.423
So you just need the ledger?

00:30:47.804 --> 00:30:50.682
I can change my party's stance using that.

00:30:51.349 --> 00:30:52.934
But there's one more thing

00:30:53.643 --> 00:30:54.978
we need to consider.

00:30:56.521 --> 00:30:57.355
What is it?

00:30:59.357 --> 00:31:01.276
A few days ago, Cha Su-yeon started

00:31:01.818 --> 00:31:04.654
getting people in your party on her side.

00:31:05.864 --> 00:31:08.366
Think about it. I shift my party's stance,

00:31:08.449 --> 00:31:11.160
and your party's assemblymen
end up backing out.

00:31:13.079 --> 00:31:14.372
That could actually happen.

00:31:17.333 --> 00:31:18.710
I'll handle it myself.

00:31:19.586 --> 00:31:22.046
I'll keep the party members' votes
under control

00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:23.590
and get the ledger.

00:31:24.632 --> 00:31:25.550
Really?

00:31:26.426 --> 00:31:29.220
Secretary Shin,
you're ready to go all out.

00:31:29.304 --> 00:31:30.889
I like it. You're fierce.

00:31:32.432 --> 00:31:33.433
My goodness.

00:31:33.516 --> 00:31:35.059
SHAMAN SEON

00:31:36.269 --> 00:31:37.103
Excuse me.

00:31:39.439 --> 00:31:40.607
Hello?

00:31:41.107 --> 00:31:42.817
Did you get in touch with Hwa-jin?

00:31:42.901 --> 00:31:45.820
Secretary Shin, please help me.

00:31:47.739 --> 00:31:49.782
Please help my brother.

00:31:52.869 --> 00:31:56.748
HASEONG POLICE STATION

00:31:56.831 --> 00:31:58.666
Okay, to summarize what you said,

00:32:00.418 --> 00:32:03.212
you don't remember
where or how you got the necklace.

00:32:06.633 --> 00:32:07.967
Are you listening to me?

00:32:10.219 --> 00:32:13.848
You don't even remember that
but sold it to Jang Hong-seok for 3 mill?

00:32:13.932 --> 00:32:15.934
I didn't get the money yet.

00:32:16.017 --> 00:32:17.518
He was supposed to sell--

00:32:17.602 --> 00:32:20.355
"I'll pay you
after selling the stolen goods." Right?

00:32:20.855 --> 00:32:23.650
Stop, stop!

00:32:23.733 --> 00:32:25.109
Hello.

00:32:26.569 --> 00:32:27.570
Hello.

00:32:31.908 --> 00:32:34.953
Forget about anything and everything
that's been said.

00:32:35.036 --> 00:32:37.580
From now on, I decide
what you can and cannot say.

00:32:37.664 --> 00:32:40.625
Open that mouth only when I allow you to.

00:32:42.293 --> 00:32:43.169
Are you a lawyer?

00:32:43.252 --> 00:32:44.337
Yes, I am.

00:32:44.921 --> 00:32:47.340
I am Seon U-yeong's legal representative,

00:32:49.217 --> 00:32:51.344
Lawyer Kang Seon-ho.

00:32:51.427 --> 00:32:54.430
"Seon" here doesn't mean "kind."
It means "vicious."

00:32:58.518 --> 00:32:59.936
LAWYER
KANG SEON-HO

00:33:00.019 --> 00:33:02.021
You're the lawyer that was on TV.

00:33:02.105 --> 00:33:03.523
Ms. Cha's divorce lawyer?

00:33:03.606 --> 00:33:05.149
Yes, that's me.

00:33:05.233 --> 00:33:07.151
It is me, but right now,

00:33:07.777 --> 00:33:09.612
I'm Seon U-yeong's lawyer.

00:33:10.488 --> 00:33:14.200
I'm sorry. A famous lawyer isn't
exactly helpful to a client.

00:33:14.283 --> 00:33:16.494
But I got a bit famous, you see.

00:33:19.497 --> 00:33:21.541
But he even refused a public defender.

00:33:21.624 --> 00:33:22.959
I don't need a lawyer.

00:33:23.042 --> 00:33:25.878
I submitted a letter of engagement
Ms. Seon Su-mi signed.

00:33:25.962 --> 00:33:26.838
I don't need you.

00:33:26.921 --> 00:33:27.839
Listen, Mr. Seon.

00:33:27.922 --> 00:33:30.049
I said, I don't want a lawyer!

00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:33.136
I'm allergic to lawyers.

00:33:35.847 --> 00:33:36.806
Detective.

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:39.392
Can you give us ten minutes?

00:33:39.475 --> 00:33:41.686
I don't need you here. Get lost.

00:33:41.769 --> 00:33:43.813
I'm here because Hwa-jin asked.

00:33:46.941 --> 00:33:48.443
Just ten minutes, please.

00:33:48.526 --> 00:33:52.238
I'll briefly explain the right
to legal defense to my client.

00:33:53.364 --> 00:33:56.159
The whole day of interrogation
was for nothing.

00:33:57.493 --> 00:33:59.245
Sure, let's do that, Mr. Lawyer.

00:34:00.538 --> 00:34:03.458
I'll be back in ten.
Explain his rights to him.

00:34:39.619 --> 00:34:41.037
Hello?

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:44.624
It's Kang Seon-ho.
We met in the hospital just now.

00:34:45.208 --> 00:34:48.461
As you said, Hwa-jin, he hated me
when I said I was a lawyer.

00:34:48.544 --> 00:34:49.545
A hospital?

00:34:49.629 --> 00:34:51.923
Is Hwa-jin sick? Did she faint again?

00:34:52.507 --> 00:34:54.842
I'll put him on the phone. Talk to him.

00:34:58.679 --> 00:35:01.432
Hey, Hwa-jin. Are you sick?
Why are you in a hospital?

00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:03.768
Did you faint again?

00:35:04.852 --> 00:35:05.686
U-yeong.

00:35:06.687 --> 00:35:08.481
Yes. Are you hurt?

00:35:08.564 --> 00:35:09.982
Are you okay?

00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:13.361
Don't worry about me,
and do as the lawyer says.

00:35:14.278 --> 00:35:16.197
I don't need a lawyer.

00:35:17.448 --> 00:35:20.159
Just do exactly as the lawyer says.

00:35:20.243 --> 00:35:21.661
Then you'll be released.

00:35:21.744 --> 00:35:22.787
Hwa-jin.

00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:24.038
Do as I say.

00:35:25.414 --> 00:35:26.749
Put the lawyer on.

00:35:34.924 --> 00:35:35.842
It's me.

00:35:37.176 --> 00:35:38.678
He'll do as you say now.

00:35:40.346 --> 00:35:41.556
Please make sure

00:35:42.348 --> 00:35:43.766
U-yeong is released.

00:35:48.062 --> 00:35:50.273
Okay, I'll try my best.

00:35:52.567 --> 00:35:54.777
Mr. Seon, as I said earlier,

00:35:57.905 --> 00:36:02.118
from now on, open that mouth of yours
only when I tell you to.

00:36:02.201 --> 00:36:03.661
Do you understand?

00:36:13.504 --> 00:36:15.256
It's done now.

00:36:16.883 --> 00:36:19.010
Fortunately, the wound healed nicely.

00:36:19.093 --> 00:36:21.262
Despite keeping the stitches in
for too long,

00:36:21.345 --> 00:36:22.763
there isn't any inflammation.

00:36:23.598 --> 00:36:26.184
I'm sorry. I've been a bit out of it.

00:36:27.518 --> 00:36:28.728
I do understand.

00:36:29.812 --> 00:36:32.732
I'll prescribe you antibiotics
just in case.

00:36:32.815 --> 00:36:35.276
If you get an inflammation or pus,

00:36:35.359 --> 00:36:37.403
come and see me immediately.

00:36:37.486 --> 00:36:38.905
I will.

00:36:38.988 --> 00:36:40.156
Oh, right.

00:36:40.239 --> 00:36:41.908
Lee Hwa-jin came back.

00:36:42.867 --> 00:36:46.829
Oh, I've been meaning to ask
about her symptoms.

00:36:46.913 --> 00:36:50.041
She says she suddenly faints sometimes.

00:36:50.875 --> 00:36:53.586
Yes. It's a vasovagal syncope symptom.

00:36:54.337 --> 00:36:56.672
The symptom itself is an illness in a way.

00:36:57.548 --> 00:36:59.967
Is there no prodrome at all?

00:37:00.051 --> 00:37:02.178
No, and that makes it more problematic.

00:37:02.261 --> 00:37:04.305
There isn't a treatment either.

00:37:04.889 --> 00:37:06.515
It's often hereditary.

00:37:07.058 --> 00:37:10.770
For example, if the mom has the symptom,
the daughter has it too.

00:37:13.272 --> 00:37:15.358
I heard she was admitted to the hospital.

00:37:15.441 --> 00:37:18.236
Does she have
any other issue beside fainting?

00:37:22.114 --> 00:37:23.241
She's fine.

00:37:23.324 --> 00:37:25.576
We're trying to solve
another issue instead.

00:37:40.633 --> 00:37:43.427
SPECIAL ACT
FOR H CHEMICAL FIRE REINVESTIGATION

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:46.472
You can't protect

00:37:46.555 --> 00:37:48.891
both Su-yeon and the special act.

00:37:49.892 --> 00:37:51.894
You should let go of one of them.

00:38:02.655 --> 00:38:04.282
What would you do if you were me?

00:38:04.365 --> 00:38:05.491
Who would you choose?

00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:08.244
I already made my choice.

00:38:14.083 --> 00:38:16.043
MY DAUGHTER

00:38:21.007 --> 00:38:21.966
Hello?

00:38:25.011 --> 00:38:26.345
Are you free to talk?

00:38:27.763 --> 00:38:28.848
Yes.

00:38:31.392 --> 00:38:33.311
You decided not to go abroad.

00:38:33.853 --> 00:38:35.813
Have you thought carefully about it?

00:38:37.732 --> 00:38:39.275
I believe in you,

00:38:40.651 --> 00:38:42.445
but I'm worried about your school life.

00:38:44.196 --> 00:38:46.073
Is everything else okay?

00:38:46.157 --> 00:38:47.825
Dad, can you just…

00:38:51.871 --> 00:38:53.706
not get divorced?

00:39:05.926 --> 00:39:09.305
Do you remember I used to like a tricycle
when I was young?

00:39:09.972 --> 00:39:10.931
Yes.

00:39:12.641 --> 00:39:13.601
I remember.

00:39:14.352 --> 00:39:16.187
You always brought it into your room

00:39:17.521 --> 00:39:19.648
before sleeping when Mom told you not to.

00:39:19.732 --> 00:39:21.317
You got scolded every time.

00:39:23.027 --> 00:39:27.239
Do you remember what I said
whenever Mom scolded me?

00:39:31.118 --> 00:39:33.829
I was too young to remember it,

00:39:35.706 --> 00:39:37.375
but you and Mom

00:39:38.042 --> 00:39:39.919
always teased me about it.

00:39:41.879 --> 00:39:43.130
What did you say?

00:39:44.632 --> 00:39:47.718
Apparently, I said
our family was like a tricycle.

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:50.721
Since we were a family of three.

00:39:52.807 --> 00:39:55.101
And a tricycle has three wheels.

00:39:56.727 --> 00:39:58.521
You said it was just like us.

00:39:59.647 --> 00:40:02.566
So whenever we came across a tricycle
on the streets,

00:40:03.692 --> 00:40:05.778
you brought the story up and teased me.

00:40:08.239 --> 00:40:09.698
We didn't tease you.

00:40:10.699 --> 00:40:12.201
We were proud of you.

00:40:12.785 --> 00:40:14.370
So can we just…

00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:19.708
continue to be a tricycle?

00:40:25.673 --> 00:40:28.884
-Ji-yu.
-I want to go back in time.

00:40:30.428 --> 00:40:32.430
To the time before that happened.

00:40:35.474 --> 00:40:37.518
I called to say that.

00:40:37.601 --> 00:40:38.686
I'll hang up now.

00:40:52.074 --> 00:40:53.075
Hello?

00:40:53.159 --> 00:40:56.078
Gosh, you picked up my call quickly.

00:40:56.162 --> 00:40:57.955
Were you waiting for it?

00:41:02.418 --> 00:41:03.794
Did you find anything?

00:41:03.878 --> 00:41:06.005
I met First Lady's secretary.

00:41:06.088 --> 00:41:09.675
Apparently, the First Lady met your wife
in your home five years ago.

00:41:10.301 --> 00:41:14.555
Thankfully, the secretary kept
a thorough diary.

00:41:14.638 --> 00:41:18.392
It was January 10. She was sure of it.

00:41:18.476 --> 00:41:19.560
That day,

00:41:20.269 --> 00:41:22.563
in the car on the way back home

00:41:22.646 --> 00:41:26.442
from meeting your wife,
the president and his wife

00:41:26.525 --> 00:41:30.070
discussed meeting you in person.

00:41:31.071 --> 00:41:32.490
-Meeting me?
-Yes.

00:41:32.573 --> 00:41:35.075
The president wanted to meet you,

00:41:35.159 --> 00:41:39.288
but the First Lady stopped him,
saying Cha Su-yeon wouldn't let it happen.

00:41:39.371 --> 00:41:41.957
That's how they always do things,
apparently.

00:41:42.458 --> 00:41:46.921
If they have a difference of opinion,
they follow whatever the First Lady says.

00:41:47.588 --> 00:41:49.173
I wasn't sure at first,

00:41:49.256 --> 00:41:53.969
but that was around the time
I planted the bugging device on you.

00:41:54.053 --> 00:41:58.057
I went through my transaction records

00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:00.100
around that time.

00:42:00.184 --> 00:42:02.520
I found a record of the transfer I made

00:42:03.229 --> 00:42:06.273
to buy the old wiretap.

00:42:08.651 --> 00:42:10.319
She started bugging me

00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:14.490
right after she made a deal
with the president.

00:42:14.573 --> 00:42:18.035
You entrusted this job to me
knowing all about this from the start, no?

00:42:18.994 --> 00:42:19.995
No.

00:42:20.704 --> 00:42:25.167
When someone bugs someone,
it usually means there's an issue.

00:42:25.251 --> 00:42:29.838
Like when someone is having an affair
or is suspected of having an affair.

00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:32.716
We didn't have such issues.

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:34.385
Then,

00:42:34.468 --> 00:42:38.681
there might've been an issue
with the deal she made with the president.

00:42:40.224 --> 00:42:43.227
It wasn't because I didn't trust him.

00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:45.271
It was because I couldn't trust

00:42:45.854 --> 00:42:47.731
Hyun Min-cheol as a politician.

00:42:47.815 --> 00:42:50.109
I wasn't monitoring my husband.

00:42:50.985 --> 00:42:53.654
I was monitoring the politicians

00:42:53.737 --> 00:42:56.198
who approached Politician Hyun Min-cheol.

00:42:56.991 --> 00:42:59.785
I was protecting him from them.

00:42:59.868 --> 00:43:01.745
Because my husband is a politician,

00:43:03.163 --> 00:43:05.374
and I'm his wife, and at the same time,

00:43:05.457 --> 00:43:07.418
his political partner.

00:43:10.337 --> 00:43:12.006
Instead of monitoring me, was she

00:43:13.382 --> 00:43:16.552
monitoring the president and his wife
who tried to approach me?

00:43:17.928 --> 00:43:19.597
According to what she said,

00:43:20.848 --> 00:43:22.641
was she protecting me from them?

00:43:22.725 --> 00:43:25.269
I asked Secretary Bang for her diary.

00:43:25.853 --> 00:43:27.730
A copy of it, at least.

00:43:28.564 --> 00:43:32.568
I'll get more conclusive clues
once I read that.

00:43:32.651 --> 00:43:33.736
Buy the diary.

00:43:34.987 --> 00:43:36.822
I must read the diary right now.

00:43:51.462 --> 00:43:54.340
When will you get U-yeong released?

00:43:56.216 --> 00:43:57.259
Be patient.

00:43:58.135 --> 00:43:59.970
I'll do what you want.

00:44:00.554 --> 00:44:02.181
Just make sure to keep the promise.

00:44:02.765 --> 00:44:05.392
The promise that you'll do whatever I say.

00:44:06.935 --> 00:44:09.146
Okay, I'll keep my word.

00:44:10.606 --> 00:44:12.316
Stay in the hospital for now.

00:44:12.399 --> 00:44:14.234
I'll hire a caregiver for you.

00:44:14.943 --> 00:44:16.111
I don't need one.

00:44:16.695 --> 00:44:18.280
I'm not here because I'm sick.

00:44:19.531 --> 00:44:20.366
Okay, then.

00:44:24.662 --> 00:44:25.954
Ms. Cha.

00:44:28.832 --> 00:44:30.834
Can I ask a question?

00:44:37.466 --> 00:44:40.386
What is it like to be a mom?

00:44:46.433 --> 00:44:48.227
Is it okay

00:44:49.061 --> 00:44:52.231
for someone like me to be a mom?

00:44:58.904 --> 00:45:01.365
I'm not rich or educated

00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:03.826
like you.

00:45:05.619 --> 00:45:08.372
Is someone like me qualified to be a mom?

00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:22.136
There's no such qualification.

00:45:24.888 --> 00:45:26.890
You can't learn how to be one either.

00:45:33.272 --> 00:45:34.898
But one thing's for sure.

00:45:37.609 --> 00:45:39.736
If you plan to give birth to the baby,

00:45:40.696 --> 00:45:41.822
don't doubt yourself.

00:45:43.907 --> 00:45:46.743
How anxious would the baby feel
if they knew?

00:45:49.413 --> 00:45:50.747
If you're going to have it,

00:45:52.249 --> 00:45:53.959
don't make your baby feel anxious.

00:45:59.506 --> 00:46:00.632
Thank you.

00:46:46.011 --> 00:46:47.137
It's ticklish.

00:46:47.221 --> 00:46:49.348
It's ticklish! Stop.

00:46:49.973 --> 00:46:51.808
You pressed down my head first.

00:46:51.892 --> 00:46:53.727
-Stop.
-You started it.

00:46:53.810 --> 00:46:55.437
It's really ticklish!

00:46:55.521 --> 00:46:57.981
Get out. I need to use the toilet.

00:47:02.361 --> 00:47:04.488
Must I do the MBS interview tomorrow?

00:47:06.865 --> 00:47:08.242
Tomorrow?

00:47:08.325 --> 00:47:09.868
Wasn't it on the 17th?

00:47:10.869 --> 00:47:12.246
Tomorrow is the 17th.

00:47:14.414 --> 00:47:16.083
Tomorrow is the 17th?

00:47:16.917 --> 00:47:18.210
Not the seventh?

00:47:19.461 --> 00:47:20.796
Goodness, madam.

00:47:21.296 --> 00:47:23.966
How could you mistake the day by ten days?

00:47:30.222 --> 00:47:35.769
PREGNANCY TEST KIT

00:47:54.329 --> 00:47:55.330
What's wrong?

00:47:56.498 --> 00:47:58.166
You're acting strange.

00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:01.795
What happened?

00:48:18.604 --> 00:48:20.063
Can someone like me…

00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:26.236
give birth to a child and become a mom?

00:48:29.156 --> 00:48:31.700
When my mom died because of me?

00:48:35.579 --> 00:48:37.039
Can I really do that?

00:48:42.252 --> 00:48:44.630
Had my mom not given birth to me,

00:48:45.964 --> 00:48:49.509
she wouldn't have been criticized
for giving birth out of wedlock.

00:48:53.555 --> 00:48:56.224
And she wouldn't have died like that.

00:48:59.936 --> 00:49:02.689
How can I have a child and become a mom?

00:49:05.192 --> 00:49:07.027
How can someone like me…

00:49:21.458 --> 00:49:22.876
Why would you say that?

00:49:24.044 --> 00:49:25.629
You'll make a good mom.

00:49:28.131 --> 00:49:30.842
You always nag at me,
saying do this, don't do that.

00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:34.971
You always worry about me,
asking if I ate or if I'm cold.

00:49:36.139 --> 00:49:37.516
That's what a mom does.

00:49:38.225 --> 00:49:40.477
And that's what you always do to me.

00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:42.437
That's what you're best at.

00:49:44.106 --> 00:49:45.190
You are

00:49:45.857 --> 00:49:47.359
more than qualified.

00:49:48.985 --> 00:49:50.570
So don't worry.

00:50:08.797 --> 00:50:10.090
Thank you.

00:51:24.206 --> 00:51:27.667
Gosh, it's late.
Why don't you grab a meal?

00:51:28.210 --> 00:51:30.545
I'm feeling hungry too.
My stomach is growling.

00:51:31.963 --> 00:51:33.048
This is how you'll play?

00:51:33.131 --> 00:51:34.299
Pardon?

00:51:35.592 --> 00:51:36.676
Fine, let's.

00:51:39.971 --> 00:51:41.097
Goodness.

00:51:45.602 --> 00:51:46.645
Well…

00:51:54.820 --> 00:51:57.948
Good. You're doing very well.
We're starting to work well together.

00:51:58.657 --> 00:51:59.741
How long do we do this?

00:52:01.284 --> 00:52:04.079
Okay, I'll make it easy
for you to understand.

00:52:04.955 --> 00:52:06.706
The cop is an attacker.

00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:08.041
And we are?

00:52:09.042 --> 00:52:10.502
Defenders.

00:52:10.585 --> 00:52:14.548
He will attack us nonstop,
and we have to endure it.

00:52:15.549 --> 00:52:16.591
Until when?

00:52:19.010 --> 00:52:21.012
A higher-up will give an order.

00:52:21.596 --> 00:52:22.722
A higher-up?

00:52:22.806 --> 00:52:23.807
Who?

00:52:24.349 --> 00:52:25.225
Cha Su-yeon?

00:52:25.809 --> 00:52:26.768
Yes. What about it?

00:52:28.019 --> 00:52:30.230
I just have a bad feeling about it.

00:52:30.939 --> 00:52:33.066
Things get messed up when she's involved.

00:52:37.529 --> 00:52:38.572
By the way,

00:52:39.406 --> 00:52:41.074
why do you hate lawyers so much?

00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:47.455
Your file says you were underage
and it was your first offense,

00:52:47.539 --> 00:52:51.042
but you refused to get help
from a lawyer to the end. Why?

00:52:55.213 --> 00:52:59.134
YEAR 2022

00:53:12.188 --> 00:53:13.273
No.

00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:18.278
Wake up.

00:53:18.361 --> 00:53:20.030
Open your eyes!

00:53:22.782 --> 00:53:23.783
Hey.

00:53:24.367 --> 00:53:25.577
Can you sit up?

00:53:33.418 --> 00:53:34.502
Are you okay?

00:53:34.586 --> 00:53:35.962
Can you hear me?

00:53:52.062 --> 00:53:53.104
Let's say

00:53:53.688 --> 00:53:55.231
I stole the motorcycle.

00:53:56.191 --> 00:53:57.734
Let's say I rode it.

00:53:58.693 --> 00:54:01.821
-You? Why?
-You faint all the time.

00:54:02.405 --> 00:54:04.115
You can't survive juvie.

00:54:08.578 --> 00:54:09.746
I'll go instead.

00:54:12.082 --> 00:54:13.083
U-yeong.

00:54:14.876 --> 00:54:16.252
Why did you refuse help?

00:54:16.336 --> 00:54:18.338
You must have a reason.

00:54:18.421 --> 00:54:20.382
I'll exercise my right

00:54:22.258 --> 00:54:23.301
to legal defense.

00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:25.136
What do you mean?

00:54:25.220 --> 00:54:27.097
I don't want to talk about it.

00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:28.014
Got it?

00:54:29.015 --> 00:54:31.977
If you don't want to, it can't be helped.

00:54:33.645 --> 00:54:34.854
What do you want to eat?

00:54:36.231 --> 00:54:38.400
Korean? Chinese?

00:54:38.942 --> 00:54:40.318
I want a big portion.

00:54:40.402 --> 00:54:41.569
Chinese, then.

00:54:41.653 --> 00:54:43.571
Jjajangmyeon large? Jjamppong large?

00:54:45.949 --> 00:54:46.950
Damn it.

00:54:49.494 --> 00:54:51.287
This always makes me think twice.

00:54:51.955 --> 00:54:52.872
What should I eat?

00:55:02.757 --> 00:55:04.009
Secretary Shin.

00:55:04.092 --> 00:55:05.010
How did it go?

00:55:05.719 --> 00:55:06.928
Things worked out.

00:55:07.012 --> 00:55:09.264
Ms. Cha sent a lawyer.

00:55:09.347 --> 00:55:10.348
A lawyer?

00:55:10.932 --> 00:55:13.018
Yes. Well…

00:55:14.853 --> 00:55:17.397
Oh? It's him.

00:55:19.899 --> 00:55:21.317
How did it go?

00:55:21.401 --> 00:55:22.736
Will U-yeong be released?

00:55:23.903 --> 00:55:26.448
Not yet. We just had dinner.

00:55:28.199 --> 00:55:30.118
The investigation's not over yet.

00:55:30.869 --> 00:55:32.245
We'll talk again later.

00:55:32.328 --> 00:55:33.288
That aside,

00:55:35.415 --> 00:55:37.083
what brings you here?

00:55:38.501 --> 00:55:42.464
Well, I called her for help
before I got in touch with you.

00:55:44.549 --> 00:55:45.800
We finally meet.

00:55:46.468 --> 00:55:48.303
Lawyer Kang Seon-ho.

00:55:48.928 --> 00:55:50.472
You know me.

00:55:50.555 --> 00:55:52.265
Secretary Shin Hae-rin.

00:55:53.475 --> 00:55:55.226
You know me too.

00:55:55.310 --> 00:55:56.644
As you can see.

00:55:56.728 --> 00:55:59.773
We get to meet in the police station
before going to court.

00:56:00.857 --> 00:56:03.818
Procedure-wise, that is the correct order.

00:56:05.779 --> 00:56:07.322
Can we

00:56:07.405 --> 00:56:09.032
have a word?

00:56:12.994 --> 00:56:15.413
I have ten minutes. Is that all right?

00:56:15.997 --> 00:56:17.040
That's enough.

00:56:19.751 --> 00:56:21.044
Excuse me.

00:56:23.046 --> 00:56:24.047
Hello?

00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:26.091
Ms. Cha has come over.

00:56:26.716 --> 00:56:28.301
She's with the president-elect.

00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:39.062
I've been meaning to meet you.

00:56:39.145 --> 00:56:40.230
I have a question.

00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:43.274
What is it?

00:56:45.151 --> 00:56:47.195
You go first. You came all the way here.

00:56:51.241 --> 00:56:52.450
Lee Hwa-jin.

00:56:54.702 --> 00:56:55.995
She's pregnant.

00:56:57.330 --> 00:56:58.665
What will happen

00:56:59.582 --> 00:57:03.002
if the news says the baby is yours?

00:57:04.129 --> 00:57:06.047
You will deny it, of course.

00:57:06.131 --> 00:57:09.384
But Lee Hwa-jin will come forward herself.

00:57:10.802 --> 00:57:12.762
And say the baby is yours.

00:57:13.388 --> 00:57:14.639
That the baby

00:57:16.224 --> 00:57:17.684
is your illegitimate child.

00:57:20.145 --> 00:57:21.354
You…

00:57:22.522 --> 00:57:25.775
Your first appearance on the news
is what people remember you as.

00:57:27.152 --> 00:57:29.863
Just like how they remember you
as a survivor of a fire,

00:57:29.946 --> 00:57:31.573
people remember me

00:57:32.615 --> 00:57:34.325
from the news when I was seven.

00:57:39.747 --> 00:57:41.958
An illegitimate child of Cha Jin-taek

00:57:42.542 --> 00:57:43.668
and his mistress.

00:57:45.295 --> 00:57:46.713
Her mom killed herself,

00:57:48.381 --> 00:57:51.176
and only after that,
she was adopted by her father.

00:57:52.302 --> 00:57:53.428
The seed of misfortune.

00:57:54.471 --> 00:57:57.182
That's people's first memory of me.

00:57:57.265 --> 00:57:59.642
And now that I've become the First Lady,

00:58:01.102 --> 00:58:03.146
I find out my husband, the President,

00:58:03.771 --> 00:58:05.273
has an illegitimate child.

00:58:09.110 --> 00:58:10.778
Isn't it such cruel fate?

00:58:11.863 --> 00:58:12.739
Stop.

00:58:12.822 --> 00:58:16.701
A girl who was cursed since birth
and cannot escape her misfortune.

00:58:21.581 --> 00:58:22.540
What do you want?

00:58:24.501 --> 00:58:25.752
To go back…

00:58:27.587 --> 00:58:28.671
to the time

00:58:29.839 --> 00:58:31.591
before you came up with the special act.

00:58:31.674 --> 00:58:33.134
You'll stop me until the end?

00:58:33.218 --> 00:58:34.969
You did the best you could.

00:58:35.553 --> 00:58:36.721
So,

00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:38.848
stop here.

00:58:40.099 --> 00:58:41.351
Is that what you want?

00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:44.687
You even dug up

00:58:46.314 --> 00:58:48.733
your painful memories
that have tormented you

00:58:49.901 --> 00:58:52.862
and got a fake illegitimate child,
because you want me to stop?

00:58:58.868 --> 00:58:59.702
Answer me.

00:59:01.329 --> 00:59:02.163
Yes.

00:59:03.915 --> 00:59:06.501
I want us to go back,
like nothing has happened.

00:59:06.584 --> 00:59:09.295
Because nothing has happened.

00:59:59.887 --> 01:00:02.849
There's another way
to get U-yeong released.

01:00:02.932 --> 01:00:04.142
I've seen it before.

01:00:04.225 --> 01:00:06.394
A safe in the dressing room.

01:00:06.477 --> 01:00:10.148
One word from me,
and you're done for, Hyun Min-cheol!

01:00:10.231 --> 01:00:12.692
You want to threaten the assemblymen

01:00:13.276 --> 01:00:14.777
and force them to vote in favor?

01:00:14.861 --> 01:00:16.904
You should stop here.

01:00:16.988 --> 01:00:18.740
Whoever stops this is the culprit.

01:00:19.949 --> 01:00:23.077
What's the truth you're afraid of
that you're going this far?

01:00:23.161 --> 01:00:24.078
I don't care

01:00:24.704 --> 01:00:27.040
as long as I can stop the special act.

01:00:27.749 --> 01:00:29.751
