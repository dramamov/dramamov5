The real Meng Yan

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.679
would definitely know

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:03.880
which chamber has the bullet

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:56.799
Why didn't you dodge?

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.680
The Jia Yuer I know

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.000
would never pull the trigger

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:12.240
You still don't believe me?

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.159
When you were eight, your parents teamed up to scold you

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:18.400
You hid at my place for a week because

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.879
Enough

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.080
Stop talking

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.120
Go take care of your own stuff

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.120
Can't you let me save face in front of my little brother?

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.479
Give me a little dignity?

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.159
And where have you been all these years?

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.719
You made me worry so much

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:45.879
You could've at least called me

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:47.599
How would I know your home number?

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.000
Fine

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.680
You even forgot my number

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.400
Every time, it's early in the morning

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.159
You'd come to my house to find me

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.080
You

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.560
You

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:57.400
And you still want me to ask around for you

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.439
Watch your tone with me

00:02:58.879 --> 00:02:59.159
You

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:02.280
The person you're looking for is Ah Q

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.360
I've already asked about him

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:04.800
He's a regular at the casino

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.280
Pretty well-known around here

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.840
Why?

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:09.800
Is it because he's good at cards?

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:12.800
No, it's because his manners are terrible

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.879
He loses a game and instantly gets mad

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.800
When he's mad, he flips the table

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.680
After flipping the table, he gets beaten up

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:21.800
Then he cries and begs for forgiveness

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.280
But he still comes back the next day

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.639
Let's go to Dao's place

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.120
We should be able to find him there

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:32.000
Who said I was going with you?

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:34.400
Thanks

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.400
Let's go

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:37.680
Meng Yan, let's go together

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:40.000
Ladies

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:41.080
I really don't have time

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.199
to play games with you

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:44.400
I'll say it again

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.960
No one helped my family back then

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.879
No need to help now either

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:50.000
Let's go

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:57.639
Hey, boss

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.360
What's up?

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.400
Get me a car downstairs, quick

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.919
Okay, I'll be right there

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:01.800
You don't need to come

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.960
Are you stupid?

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:04.680
Then I'll wait in the car

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:06.520
Yeah, wait for me in the car

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.080
If I don't leave now, I'm dead

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.360
What did I say?

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.040
Boss

00:04:45.399 --> 00:04:45.800
Boss

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:46.600
Boss, let me go

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.000
Boss

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.000
Boss

00:04:48.399 --> 00:04:48.800
Boss

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:50.319
Boss

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.199
Boss

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.279
Boss

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.879
Our Young Master is on his way

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.319
He's coming

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:00.720
No one can save you now

00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:03.120
Where's that guy?

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.360
I really don't know him

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:06.600
He barged into my office

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:07.879
He had a little girl with him

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.560
That's all I know

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.480
Boss, please let me go, boss

00:05:15.959 --> 00:05:17.000
Young Master Shen, you're here

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.600
Young Master Shen

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.000
Please let me go, Young Master Shen

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.279
Young Master Shen

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.480
Young Master Shen

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.199
Young Master Shen

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.560
Young Master Shen

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:30.759
I've told you everything I know

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:31.680
Young Master

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.040
To the Shen family and Master Shen

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.199
I'm absolutely loyal

00:05:35.959 --> 00:05:36.680
Oh, right

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.519
Master Shen once said

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:39.759
We are all Children of the Master

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.160
We should care for each other, right?

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:42.600
Care for each other

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:44.959
Young Master, please let me go

00:05:45.079 --> 00:05:45.600
Young Master

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:47.600
Young Master Shen

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.160
Young Master Shen

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.360
That's true

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:55.399
My uncle is a devout believer

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.319
When we first came to this country

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.199
He'd chase someone for blocks over a good stone

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:02.959
Chase and attack them for several streets

00:06:04.519 --> 00:06:05.279
At night, he'd come home

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:07.279
and beat me for not reciting scripture

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:08.759
He'd say

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:11.680
It's because you can't recite scripture

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.079
You don't respect the Master enough

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.279
That's why our life is so hard

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:21.240
Young Master Shen

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.079
Young Master Shen

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:22.759
Young Master Shen

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.199
I'm begging you

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.879
Please let me go, Young Master Shen

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:36.519
You might truly be innocent

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.680
But for people like you who make mistakes

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.160
and use faith to forgive themselves

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:42.920
to comfort themselves

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:45.160
even manipulate others spiritually

00:06:46.399 --> 00:06:48.120
This is how I do things

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:51.480
Farewell

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.399
No

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:54.800
No

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:55.279
No

00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:56.079
They're cheating

00:06:56.199 --> 00:06:57.000
Cheating

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.160
Get lost

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:59.480
Don't let me see you again

00:06:59.839 --> 00:07:00.040
You

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:02.199
Me

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:14.800
Hey

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.399
A guy about your age

00:07:17.399 --> 00:07:19.000
with a seven or eight-year-old girl

00:07:19.319 --> 00:07:20.600
came to your place looking for Ah Q

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.600
Keep an eye out for me

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.480
I'll be there soon

00:07:31.959 --> 00:07:32.480
Spare me, hero!

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:32.879
Please, have mercy!

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.000
I don't know anything.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.319
I don't know.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:38.800
Young Master Meng

00:07:40.079 --> 00:07:40.879
You are...

00:07:41.399 --> 00:07:42.160
Master

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.279
It's me, Master.

00:07:43.399 --> 00:07:44.600
I used to help in your kitchen.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:45.439
When you were little,

00:07:45.439 --> 00:07:46.920
you loved my date pastries the most.

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:48.600
Oh.

00:07:48.959 --> 00:07:50.519
So it was you.

00:07:50.959 --> 00:07:52.199
If you hadn't said anything,

00:07:52.199 --> 00:07:53.399
I wouldn't have remembered.

00:07:54.199 --> 00:07:54.839
It was you.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.600
You never cleaned the pits out.

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.279
I always bit down on them.

00:08:01.399 --> 00:08:02.199
Speak.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:04.439
My family's Mo Fei stoneâ€”

00:08:04.439 --> 00:08:06.160
Did you sell it to the auction house?

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.319
Master, what are you talking about?

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:09.519
I don't know.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:11.959
Where did you find him?

00:08:13.399 --> 00:08:14.720
At an auction.

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.199
I heard Meng family items were up for sale.

00:08:17.199 --> 00:08:18.120
So I went there.

00:08:18.759 --> 00:08:20.399
Didn't expect him to show up too.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.079
He's been hiding all these years.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.399
He must've suffered a lot.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.399
So I don't blame him for acting that way.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.799
You know what I can do, right?

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.799
You really want to force me?

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:39.360
Let me warn you.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.720
I'm not that skilled with this trick yet.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.000
Still not very practiced.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.759
If I use it on you,

00:08:43.759 --> 00:08:45.159
it might leave side effects.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.120
Like brain damage,

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.320
paralysis,

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.639
or loss of control over your body.

00:08:50.639 --> 00:08:50.919
No, please!

00:08:50.919 --> 00:08:53.000
Don't say I didn't warn you.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:54.720
Please!

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.679
I know the Meng family's ways.

00:08:56.799 --> 00:08:58.399
I'll talk.

00:08:59.919 --> 00:09:00.720
Speak now.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.320
It was that night.

00:09:02.919 --> 00:09:03.200
I...

00:09:03.639 --> 00:09:04.519
I stole it.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:05.799
That night.

00:09:07.399 --> 00:09:08.960
You were there the night my family was killed.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.679
I should've left early that night.

00:09:13.159 --> 00:09:14.960
But the date pastries weren't done.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.279
The chef made me redo a batch.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.120
I fell asleep under the stove.

00:09:19.679 --> 00:09:22.120
When I woke up, there was chaos outside.

00:09:22.399 --> 00:09:23.759
I didn't know what was happening.

00:09:24.399 --> 00:09:25.399
I went out to look.

00:09:25.399 --> 00:09:26.759
There were bodies everywhere.

00:09:26.799 --> 00:09:28.000
Blood everywhere.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:31.480
I figured the master and madam were gone.

00:09:31.799 --> 00:09:33.799
The Meng family was finished.

00:09:34.159 --> 00:09:37.399
So I thought, no one wants the stuff now.

00:09:37.799 --> 00:09:39.600
I took whatever I could.

00:09:39.799 --> 00:09:42.320
Gambled it all away over the years.

00:09:42.399 --> 00:09:43.679
Only that one thing was left.

00:09:43.879 --> 00:09:46.519
But I lost too much recently.

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.000
So I sold it too.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:49.600
Who bought it?

00:09:50.159 --> 00:09:51.559
The auction house owner.

00:09:51.559 --> 00:09:52.799
He looked like bad news.

00:09:53.399 --> 00:09:54.279
No one else.

00:09:55.679 --> 00:09:56.039
That's it.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.159
Just him.

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.360
If you don't believe me, check yourself.

00:09:59.679 --> 00:10:00.600
I know the Meng family

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.679
can read people's minds.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.200
Nothing can be hidden from you.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.159
I remember when his family had trouble.

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.360
My dad suddenly, for no reason,

00:10:09.399 --> 00:10:11.200
insisted I go north to see my uncle.

00:10:11.919 --> 00:10:13.480
When I came back,

00:10:13.799 --> 00:10:15.360
his house was empty.

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.399
So I think

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:18.960
what happened to his familyâ€”

00:10:19.759 --> 00:10:20.879
our elders

00:10:20.879 --> 00:10:22.000
must've known about it.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:25.559
Me too.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.200
A few days before his family was attacked,

00:10:29.759 --> 00:10:30.840
my mom suddenly asked me

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.080
if I wanted to study abroad.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.200
When he needed us most,

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.000
none of us were there.

00:10:36.799 --> 00:10:38.480
No wonder he's so disappointed in us.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.759
My family treated you well, right?

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:43.200
When my family was attacked,

00:10:44.159 --> 00:10:45.399
you just watched.

00:10:46.159 --> 00:10:46.960
Master.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.720
Those people killed everyone they saw.

00:10:48.799 --> 00:10:50.320
No one survived.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.960
If I hadn't hidden under the stove,

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.600
I'd be dead too.

00:10:53.919 --> 00:10:55.519
Even Aunt Cheng, the cleanerâ€”

00:10:55.679 --> 00:10:57.559
half her body was gone.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:58.559
Wait a second.

00:10:59.759 --> 00:11:01.480
You said those peopleâ€”

00:11:03.279 --> 00:11:04.320
Who else was there?

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.720
Do you remember how many?

00:11:06.919 --> 00:11:07.759
I don't remember.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.200
Will you talk or not?

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:10.200
Master.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:11.559
It's not that I won't talk.

00:11:11.559 --> 00:11:12.879
I really didn't see.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.200
I just remember one person.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.519
No, not a person.

00:11:17.519 --> 00:11:18.559
It was a Monster.

00:11:18.559 --> 00:11:19.399
It had no arms.

00:11:19.519 --> 00:11:21.159
A blade grew from where its arm should be.

00:11:21.679 --> 00:11:22.320
A blade.

00:11:22.799 --> 00:11:23.679
Master.

00:11:23.679 --> 00:11:26.000
That Monster is right behind you.
